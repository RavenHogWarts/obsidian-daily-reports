It&#39;s free and Gemini 3 Pro is supposed to be pretty decent.</p> <p>So I went for it.</p> <p>Took about 1.5 hours with a bunch of iterations (especially since I kept adding new notes during test runs lol). But honestly? It worked way better than I expected. The reorganization actually made sense.</p> <p>I was paranoid that it might screw things up even worse, so I played it safe. Made a separate vault, ran everything there first, and only swapped it into my main vault once I was happy with it.

El aprendizaje real ocurre durante el Encoding—el proceso de traducir información en bruto a una representación mental.</p> <p>El Método Cornell es famoso no solo por el diseño, sino porque te obliga a interactuar con el material. Escribir una pregunta, una palabra clave o una síntesis personal al lado de un párrafo complejo actúa como un gancho de memoria. Convierte el consumo pasivo en un diálogo activo con tus apuntes.</p> <p>El Problema: En Obsidian, intentar replicar esta estructura de &quot;nota al margen&quot; usualmente implica tablas HTML complejas o callouts. Esto interrumpe el flujo y, crucialmente para mí, arruina la generación de flashcards.</p> <p>La Solución: Cornell Marginalia Construí un plugin ligero que te permite agregar pistas semánticas y notas marginales sin saturar tu texto en bruto.</p> <p>✨ Cómo ayuda a tu estudio:</p> <pre><code>Encoding Activo: Mientras lees/escribes un bloque denso, puedes agregar instantáneamente una nota al margen para sintetizar la idea principal. Seguro para Flashcards: Usa la sintaxis de comentario nativa de Obsidian (%%). Esto significa que tus notas marginales son invisibles para otros plugins. Puedes convertir tu nota principal en flashcards sin que las pistas laterales se filtren en la tarjeta. Pistas Contextuales: Perfecto para la asociación &quot;Concepto &lt;-&gt; Palabra Clave&quot;. </code></pre> <p>⚙️ Cómo funciona: Escribe %%&gt; Tu nota aquí %% en cualquier parte de tu texto.</p> <pre><code>En el Editor: El texto se mueve instantáneamente al margen lateral (como un libro de texto). Interacción: Haz clic en la nota al margen para expandir y editar el texto original. Exportación/Lectura: Permanece oculto como un comentario. </code></pre> <p>Ejemplo:</p> <pre><code>Las mitocondrias son orgánulos celulares unidos a la membrana que generan la mayor parte de la energía química... %%&gt; &quot;Central energética&quot; (ATP) %% </code></pre> <p>📥 Cómo obtenerlo: Actualmente está disponible a través de BRAT o instalación manual:</p> <p>Repo: <a href=\"https://github.com/latazadehomero/cornell-marginalia\">https://github.com/latazadehomero/cornell-marginalia</a></p> <p>Manual: Descarga main.js, manifest.json, y styles.css de la página de Releases.</p> <p>¡Espero que esto ayude a cualquiera que busque hacer que sus sesiones de estudio sean más activas!

Was initially looking to add a specific property to the canvas files that I could then group and simply filter out of the graph mode view but I can&#39;t figure out how to do that because the option doesn&#39;t seem to exist when you right click on the Canvas files like it does with regular notes.</p> <p>Anybody else dealt with something like this or have ideas?

but the friction of re-watching a 40-minute video just to find one atomic insight was too high.</p> <p>​i finally moved to a 5-step &quot;pipeline&quot; that forces me to distill everything before it gets a permanent note.</p> <p>​<a href=\"https://raindrop.io/?hl=en-IN\">raindrop.io</a>: this is my &quot;waiting room.&quot; nothing goes into obsidian directly anymore. if i find something interesting on mobile or desktop, it goes here. if i don&#39;t touch it for a week, it gets deleted.</p> <p>​<a href=\"https://recapio.com/\">recapio</a>: this is the &quot;filter.&quot; if a video or article in raindrop is actually worth keeping, i run it through recapio first. i get a clean summary and the core insights in seconds. i usually use the &quot;video chat&quot; feature to ask specific questions like &quot;what was the exact terminal command mentioned?&quot; so i can grab just that snippet without scrubbing through the timeline.</p> <p>​<a href=\"https://www.zotero.org/\">zotero</a>: if the content is a heavy research paper or something that needs a formal citation, it goes here. i keep my &quot;academic&quot; sources separate from my general thoughts.</p> <p>​<a href=\"https://obsidian.md/\">obsidian</a> (the vault): i only move the clean text summaries and specific chat answers into my vault. because recapio gives me clean text instead of a messy web-clip, it formats perfectly as markdown. it makes my internal search 10x more useful because i’m indexing actual ideas instead of just raw urls.</p> <p>​obsidian canvas: i drag these distilled notes onto a canvas to actually &quot;see&quot; the connections between different videos and papers. it’s the first time my research has felt like a knowledge graph and not just a pile of files.</p> <p>​the result:</p> <p>my vault is actually usable now. i’m spending zero time &quot;formatting&quot; and way more time actually connecting dots. it feels like i’ve finally shifted from &quot;collecting&quot; information to actually &quot;integrating&quot; it.</p> <p>​curious if you guys have a similar pre-processing step or if you’re still clipping full pages and dealing with the bloat later.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32;

I suspected early on that LLMs could help, but most &quot;similar notes&quot; features never really delivered. Soinstead of being lazy and trying to outsource intuition to the models, what if I could use them to sharpen my own?</p> <p>That led me to semantic colour coding. Each note in my Obsidian vault gets a small circular marker in the file explorer, derived from embedding clusters. Every note maps to its top two clusters with a rough weight between them, rendered as a frosted-glass circle with a conic gradient blending the two colours. You can scan a list of notes and pick up on thematic patterns before you&#39;ve read a single title. As you start reading back your notes and connecting them to the colours, your brain starts to (subconsciously) pick up on the relation.</p> <p>The second piece (early days) was rethinking Graph View. Obsidian notes can be related in lots of ways: links, tags, topics, projects, time. But semantic proximity is usually absent. So I built a separate view that projects the embeddings into 2D via UMAP and then overlays the actual Obsidian links on top of that vector space. You get the explicit structure and the latent neighborhoods in one picture, with the same colour system carried over so nothing needs to be relearned.</p> <p>It&#39;s still early, but the graph has started suggesting paths I wouldn&#39;t have found by browsing. The whole thing currently assumes normal colour vision, which I need to fix. </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/solarbotanist\"> /u/solarbotanist </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1r3k3tt\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/ObsidianMD/comments/1r3k3tt/navigating_meaning_semantic_colour_coding_and/\">[comments]</a></span> </td></tr></table>","_source_key":"reddit","ai_summary":"用颜色编码直观展示笔记关联，辅助发现潜在联系。","ai_pain_point":"笔记库庞大时，难以在文件列表中快速发现跨主题的潜在关联。","ai_highlights":["浏览文件列表时，仅凭颜色渐变即可秒辨笔记主题归属。","辅助而非替代思考，通过色彩聚类强化你对笔记库的直觉。","依据嵌入向量聚类，直观呈现非显性链接的意外关联。"],"ai_comment":"别人用AI洗稿，他用AI把笔记库盘成了调色盘，这才是利用模型辅助直觉的正确打开方式。","ai_tags":["数据极客","颜值党专属"],"ai_score":8},{"source":"Reddit","title":"Social Archiver 2.5.6 - Reader Mode, Frontmatter Customization, Folder Organization & more","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/ObsidianMD/comments/1r3juum/social_archiver_256_reader_mode_frontmatter/","author":"/u/Jun_imgibble","created_at":"2026-02-13T08:28:18+00:00","content_text":"<table> <tr><td> <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/ObsidianMD/comments/1r3juum/social_archiver_256_reader_mode_frontmatter/\"> <img src=\"https://external-preview.redd.it/c2h0MWNnMHcxOGpnMRQbgILrQyU_acyMfA2NNPUxDfwfwcHW6OlEpW98phwn.png?width=640&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=573817235f77932b1cf9afeeb7a2ababa4275003\" alt=\"Social Archiver 2.5.6 - Reader Mode, Frontmatter Customization, Folder Organization &amp; more\" title=\"Social Archiver 2.5.6 - Reader Mode, Frontmatter Customization, Folder Organization &amp; more\" /> </a> </td><td> <!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>Hi everyone!
