Can it be useful here?</li> </ol> <h2>My use-case</h2> <p>References for an indie-game. It can be anything really: characters, items, environment, sketches, ancient gods, monsters from other games, even screenshots from some tv shows or anime, or UI elements. Anything that I think might relate and inspire me to do some progress.</p> <p>Personally I do love excalidraw plug-in, it works really fast and I love the idea of having infinitely scrollable easily navigatable area, it works much better than a scrollable page. But maybe you have some better approaches. I only have about 100 reference images yet so I am open to ideas before I fully commit into my approach.</p> <h2>Issue</h2> <p>In my current approach to references, I find a drawback in one thing: lack of search. Excalidraw is really nice to just look at when without a goal. But when you want to find something in particular, you kinda have to manually look at everything with your own eye, I cannot just type a word and instantly look what I remembered. Which makes me feel slower and will take even more time when adding more references. Excalidraw plugin seems to have some kind of search but I did not yet figure how I could apply the existing search to images in my excalidraw canvas. I see how basic notes may help me make it more searchable, but on the other hand then I don’t have this freedom of placing anything anywhere which I really do love. So it works well when my goal is a small task like creating a drawing for example, but when references are for entire project then it does not work as well due to no search. So maybe you have better approach?</p> <h2>Question</h2> <p>What is your use-case to references? What kinds of references you store in Obsidian and how? By references I mostly mean images, but if you’re having some other type of content that you need as references, maybe some texts and even music or code or anything else, please share your use-cases too: how do you store your references?

Any time I wanted to capture a job I intended to apply to, it was manual copy-paste from LinkedIn into Obsidian. I built a system that captures job posts from LinkedIn and pushes them to Obsidian, then auto-scores them with an LLM. Sharing in case it&#39;s useful.</p> <p><strong>The Problem</strong></p> <p>During a job hunt, you&#39;re sifting through dozens of postings to find the handful worth pursuing.

So you either get walls and walls of text and columns and images with no words allowed to the sides of them (which looks really bad), or use the plug-ins or templates that become null when you go in edit mode to change a single word somewhere in it (or doesn&#39;t allow things like centering columns in infoboxes).

And some plugins just straight up require you to stare at lines of CSS and html when in edit mode... If I wanted to stare at code when editing a page I would just code an html page... All of this for me I feel defeats the purpose of using obsidian as an easy to edit project manager? </p> <p>I&#39;m genuinely stumped. Should I just go full-throttle and just self-host html web pages at this point? I know html, i just don&#39;t want the hassle of programming when I want to do some worldbuilding...
