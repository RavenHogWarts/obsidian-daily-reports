It’s /deep-recon. Where Deep Research focuses in on one vector, Deep Recon goes out to look for new ideas both in your vault and on the net.</p>\n<p>This is a multi-agent skill.</p>\n<p>Four agents - Explorer, Associator, Critic, Synthesizer - run in parallel rounds. The Explorer casts a wide net across the web and your notes. The Associator finds structural parallels you hadn’t seen. The Critic stress-tests everything. The Synthesizer maps the territory: not one answer, but competing framings and the tensions between them. The work ok.</p>\n<p>The output is an Obsidian-native document structured around 3-5 competing framings of your topic. The goal is to broaden perspectives about a topic.</p>\n<p>Go to <a href=\"https://github.com/kvarnelis/deep-recon\" class=\"inline-onebox\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">GitHub - kvarnelis/deep-recon: Multi-agent reconnaissance skill for Claude Code + Obsidian</a> for the skill.

And, of course, it needs to have access to the net as well as an Obsidian instance with some version of the Claude code installed.</p>\n<p>A two-round session runs roughly 800k-1M tokens across all agents and takes 20-30 minutes.</p>\n<p>So far, I’ve been a little surprised by some of the inferences Claude has drawn, positively of course.</p>","_source_key":"english_forum","ai_summary":"多智能体并联挖掘笔记库，打破单一视角局限","ai_pain_point":"写作或研究思路卡壳，难以跳出既有思维框架，忽略笔记库中隐含的深层关联","ai_highlights":["挖掘笔记库和网络资源，解决缺乏灵感时的思路枯竭","发现跨领域的结构平行点，在分析主题时打破学科壁垒","生成多视角竞争框架，在深度思考时拓宽认知边界"],"ai_comment":"只要你的钱包够厚，这确实是个烧钱换灵感的神器；穷学生慎入，小心余额蒸发","ai_tags":["数据极客","学术党福音"],"ai_score":8}],"github_opened":[{"source":"GitHub Open","title":"Add plugin: Doodle","url":"https://github.com/obsidianmd/obsidian-releases/pull/10356","author":"alexsussy","created_at":"2026-02-19T23:33:03Z","body":"# I am submitting a new Community Plugin\r\n\r\n- [x] I attest that I have done my best to deliver a high-quality plugin, am proud of the code I have written, and would recommend it to others.
