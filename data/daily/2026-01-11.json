It may be too complex. Previously I was just using n/N, to create new folder/note. But one particular case usually caused problems with such approach: after creating a folder, you get focus on that folder, and if you want create another folder at the same level, you need to focus parent first, otherwise it will be created inside that new folder. So I decided to split bindings for files/folders.</li>\n<li>Visual selection. Initially I was using “J/K” to move and select. But after reading the forum, I noted that many of you want to have “move and preview in editor, without leaving file explorer” thing. So I decided to get it more priority by assigning “J/K” to these actions.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>I used a more basic version of this plugin for a few months, but just recently decided to rework it and release to the community, so it still may be unstable.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Please use a sandbox/testing Vault for initial testing.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I have more ideas for new features (e.g. other panes - Bookmarks, Search, Tags, Properties. Cut/Copy/Paste. Undo), but currently there is already a plenty of mappings, so I want to ensure it’s stable before moving on.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"p-351835-installation-4\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"#p-351835-installation-4\"></a>Installation</h3>\n<p><a href=\"https://github.com/denvolok/obsidian-sidebar-keyboard-navigation\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">GitHub repository</a>.</p>\n<p>As it’s not released(approved) yet for the community plugins repository, you can use the <a href=\"https://tfthacker.com/BRAT\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">BRAT</a> community plugin for installation and updating.<br>\nOr install it manually, by <a href=\"https://github.com/denvolok/obsidian-sidebar-keyboard-navigation/releases/latest\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">downloading</a>. directly from the repository.</p>\n<p>More description, demo and usage info in the repository.

I manage all my image assets in Eagle, but the workflow of getting images into Obsidian was tedious—find the image in Eagle, copy the path, convert to markdown syntax… I wanted to automate this, so I built it myself.</p> <p>Features: ∙ Search &amp; Embed: Search your Eagle library from within Obsidian and embed directly ∙ Paste/Drop Integration: Choose Eagle/Local/Cloud when pasting images ∙ Cloud Upload: Supports ImgHippo (free), Cloudflare R2, Amazon S3, WebDAV ∙ Batch Convert: Convert all local images in a note to cloud URLs with one command ∙ Cross-Platform Sync: Automatic path conversion between Mac and Windows</p> <p>About Cross-Platform Sync: If you sync your Eagle library via Dropbox/OneDrive/iCloud, you know the pain—file paths are different on Mac vs Windows. This plugin automatically converts paths to match your current OS when you open a note.</p> <p>Installation: Via BRAT: johnfkoo951/cmds-eagle Requirements: ∙ Eagle app running locally ∙ Obsidian 1.5.0+ Feedback and feature suggestions welcome.

It was such a big problem for me that I even temporarily switched to writing my stuff to Telegram instead. Things on mobile are supposed to be fast. But now we back.</p> <p>So the <code>./sync_android.sh</code> script looks like this: ```bash</p> <h1>!/bin/bash</h1> <p>sync_md_pull() { git fetch local files_fetched=$(git diff origin HEAD --name-only | wc -l | tr -d &#39; &#39;) git pull --ff 2&gt;&amp;1 &gt;/dev/null echo $files_fetched }</p> <p>sync_android_md() { git add .</p> <p>local commit_date=$(date +&quot;%y %b %d&quot;) local files_changed=$(git diff --staged --name-status | awk &#39;{print $1, substr($0, index($0,$2))}&#39; | paste -sd &quot;,&quot; - | sed &#39;s/,/, /&#39;) local num_files=$(git diff --staged --name-only | wc -l | tr -d &#39; &#39;)</p> <p>if [[ $num_files == 0 ]]; then local num_files_fetched=$(sync_md_pull) termux-notification --title &quot;nothing to commit bro💤&quot; --content &quot;yeah. and we pulled $num_files_fetched files.&quot; exit fi</p> <p>local commit_msg=&quot;☎️ at (&#39;${commit_date}) changed (${files_changed}) (${num_files} files)&quot;</p> <p>echo $commit_msg</p> <p>git commit -m &quot;$commit_msg&quot; git pull git push</p> <p>if [[ $? == 0 ]]; then termux-notification --title &quot;pushed bro✅&quot; --content &quot;$commit_msg&quot; else termux-notification --title &quot;error bro❌&quot; --content &quot;dunno check the logs $TMPDIR/obsidian_sync.log&quot; fi </p> <p>echo &quot;--------------------------------\\n&quot; }</p> <p>sync_android_md &gt;&gt;&quot;$TMPDIR/obsidian_sync.log&quot; 2&gt;&amp;1 &amp;</p> <p>echo &quot;syncing in bg... pid=$!&quot; ```</p> <p>basically the script runs <code>sync_android_md</code> function in background, saving the logs to a temp file (so that we could analyze it later if smth breaks). The function itself just calls git add, commit, and push, and also pulls before that. We call the func in background for speed (so that we don&#39;t wait for the slow git process), but we also use <code>termux-notification</code> to send a notification with the result of running the script.</p> <p>I also created a termux widget which runs this script. So the whole Obsidian sync process on my phone looks like this: write stuff, close Obsidian, and tap on the widget. The termux widget closes immediately and does stuff in bg, and I can check the notification with the command result whenever I want to.</p> <p>I also wrote a similar script for my Mac, and created an automation in Shortcuts so that whenever I quit Obsidian, it runs the <code>./sync.sh</code>. I will try to do a similar thing on Android when I figure out what automation options exist there. But even still I&#39;m pretty satisfied with the current solution.</p> <p>Feel free to criticize my bash skills. Excuse my corny notification templates.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/spaghetti_beast\"> /u/spaghetti_beast </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/ObsidianMD/comments/1qabaxg/i_got_tired_of_slow_git_plugin_so_i_wrote_a/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/ObsidianMD/comments/1qabaxg/i_got_tired_of_slow_git_plugin_so_i_wrote_a/\">[comments]</a></span>"

That&#39;s until I discovered CSS.</p> <p>For about 6 months my main procrastination technique has been learning how to make snippets and edit themes. Eventually evolved (or devolved if you look at my grades) into a fully fledged personal theme.</p> <p>I tried to translate some of the styling of William Morris&#39; Kelmscott Press printings (especially the absolutely gorgeous version of Chaucer they published). Been using it now for a couple weeks in its complete form and pretty happy.</p> <p>Still a novice when it comes to CSS but was pretty proud of how it turned out. Would love to hear any tips to improve it.</p> <p><strong>Edit:</strong> </p> <p>Thanks for the kind words. A few people asked me to share it so I have compiled it all into a <a href=\"https://gist.github.com/TitusOates/257dd896a720fd31f08f220fc56d8168\">CSS Snippet</a>. Which you can download and add to your snippet folder. </p> <p>NOTE: If you would like to get the exact style I have, I strongly recommend <strong>downloading</strong> the open source typeface <em>EB Garamond</em> from <a href=\"https://fonts.google.com/specimen/EB+Garamond\">Google Fonts</a>. It is the best way I have found to replicate that high-quality printed look (without spending ridiculous sums fonts). </p> <p>I’ve included support for the Style Settings plugin, so if you have that installed, you can tweak the a lot of the style without touching the code. </p> <p>Please have a play with it and let me know if there is anything I could improve. If there is enough demand, I might try to expand it into a fully-fledged theme for the store later on.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Professional-Ad3804\"> /u/Professional-Ad3804 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://i.redd.it/gvqkpkvgarcg1.png\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/ObsidianMD/comments/1qa6eik/made_my_own_medievalist_theme/\">[comments]</a></span> </td></tr></table>"

Obsidian makes you manually fix links, which breaks delayed sense making. Obsidian has a stable future, don&#39;t like the future of LogSeq.</p> <p>I use Obsidian. I like Obsidian. I am committed to Obsidian. But Obsidian’s aliases system is genuinely painful.</p> <p>I started my note taking journey a couple of years ago with Evernote and then jumped to Obsidian, then moved to Logseq. I really loved Logseq. Unfortunately, due to lack of communication and the lack of confidence in the direction they were moving, I moved back to Obsidian full time. It has been almost a year since I returned.</p> <p>Daily journals and tasks are first class citizen in Logseq. I have made peace with most of the tradeoffs and have adjusted to not having a this workflow in obsidian.</p> <p>Block style notetaking was really good, but was not so important for me. So, it didn&#39;t need any sort of adjustment.</p> <p>But aliases in Obsidian still drive me crazy. Especially after LogSeq.</p> <p>In Logseq, I could brain dump freely in the daily journal. I would write naturally without thinking about structure, naming, or links. Later, when revisiting notes, I would simply select words and wrap them in [[]]. Done. Those words instantly became aliases for the same concept.</p> <p>In Obsidian, aliases syntax is completely different - [[filename|alias]]. In Logseq, both the actual filename and aliases, both has same syntax - [[original note]] and [[aliased name]] - Both of them refer to same page.<br/> While trying to alias anything, I do not have to decide canonical names upfront. Many times I do not even remember the original filename as well. </p> <p>My real problem is delayed sense making. Don&#39;t know if this makes sense to others or not.</p> <p>I dump a lot of information into my vault and only process it weekly but mostly after a month or so. I do not always know that two things are the same at the time of writing.</p> <p>Example - I might write notes about a dataset called “Amazon DSP” because that is what one team calls it. Weeks later, in another meeting a different team calls the same dataset “Amazon Media” dataset or whatever 100 names it has. The realization that these are the same dataset often comes much later.</p> <p>In Logseq, adding context like these is trivial. I go to any of these pages, add a new alias, and everything just works. All references automatically connect. Concepts from two different teams connect automatically.</p> <p>In Obsidian, this is painful. They do not retroactively unify concepts. Existing notes stay fragmented unless I manually hunt them down and rewrite links. This breaks the whole idea of organic knowledge growth for me.</p> <p>For me atleast, this is not a small annoyance. This hits at the core of how I think and how I process information over time.</p> <p>These are just two examples. I have many more, which is why I am ranting.</p> <p><strong>If anyone has figured out a genuinely simple and scalable way to handle aliases in Obsidian without rewriting half the vault, I would honestly love to hear it.</strong></p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/rjachuthan\"> /u/rjachuthan </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/ObsidianMD/comments/1qa04jb/rant_about_obsidian_aliases_delayed_concept/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/ObsidianMD/comments/1qa04jb/rant_about_obsidian_aliases_delayed_concept/\">[comments]</a></span>"

Quero ser um polimata e uso o Obsidian com o método BASB, pois ele me dá uma direção muito forte sobre como organizar e processar informações. Mas quero usar meu PKM, ou segundo cérebro, para consultas o tempo todo, como se fosse um manual. O método do Tiago Forte me chamou atenção porque ele é integrado e pode ser usado em várias plataformas, o que facilita muito os projetos. Nesse método, você aprende na prática, o que não é possível no Zettelkasten. Mas isso pode ser modificado rapidamente com apenas uma pasta &quot;projetos&quot;. Muitos dizem que MOCs + dashboard é mil vezes melhor para encontrar e gerenciar notas do que o método PARA. Você usa o método BASB no Obsidian? Como você o utiliza para se tornar um polimata? Como você sabe para qual pasta cada nota vai? Pode até me mostrar seu framework? Seria muito útil.
