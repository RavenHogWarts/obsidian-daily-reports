Those that subscribe to only using MOC’s would say I start with a D&amp;D MOC/Lore MOC etc, then linking to Character and Town MOC’s which work as their own indexes—sure, that makes sense. After some experimenting though, you can absolutely link to notes in a different folder, which was the whole point of structuring notes on a SINGULAR topic as one big MOC, which by comparison seems very messy. I see no fundamentally difference in having separate Town and Character folders underneath one primary D&amp;D folder, each with their own MOC as a note under each folder, and MOC’s in subfolders where needed. This seems far more organized and can link together in the exact same way. </p> <p>My question in the end, what is the benefit of doing it all in a single (or very few folders) when the functionality appears the same.
