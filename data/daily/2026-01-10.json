I also wanted to make writing flashcards feel human and organisation of the cards simple – less time spent tagging cards and moving deck chairs around.</p> <h1>How it works</h1> <p>You write your note (e.g. a revision note) and add simple, human-readable flashcards at the bottom (screenshot six). No coding needed, just a consistent format:</p> <ul> <li><strong>T:</strong> Question title</li> <li><strong>Q / CQ / MCQ:</strong> Basic, Cloze, or MCQ prompt</li> <li><strong>A / O:</strong> Answers and options for Basic and MCQ cards</li> <li><strong>I:</strong> Extra information or an explanation</li> </ul> <h1>Example One (Basic)</h1> <p><code>T: Antibiotics – Mechanism (Basic)</code><br/> <code>Q: What is the mechanism of action of beta-lactam antibiotics?</code><br/> <code>A: Inhibit bacterial cell wall synthesis by binding penicillin-binding proteins (transpeptidases), preventing peptidoglycan cross-linking.</code><br/> <code>I: Bactericidal; time-dependent killing. Resistance commonly via beta-lactamases or altered PBPs.</code></p> <h1>Example Two (MCQ)</h1> <p><code>T: Acid–Base – Metabolic Acidosis (MCQ)</code><br/> <code>MCQ: Which scenario is most consistent with a high anion gap metabolic acidosis?</code><br/> <code>O: Vomiting with hypochloraemia | **Diabetic ketoacidosis** | Diarrhoea | Proximal renal tubular acidosis (type 2)</code><br/> <code>I: Diarrhoea and RTA typically cause normal anion gap (hyperchloraemic) metabolic acidosis. DKA causes high anion gap.</code></p> <h1>Example Three (Cloze)</h1> <p><code>T: Endocrine – Thyroid (Cloze)</code><br/> <code>CQ: In primary hypothyroidism, {{c1::TSH}} is typically {{c2::elevated}} and free {{c3::T4}} is typically {{c4::low}}.</code><br/> <code>I: Contrast with secondary (pituitary) hypothyroidism: TSH is low or inappropriately normal with low free T4.</code></p> <p>On your next sync, the plugin assigns a unique ID (visible in your note as an anchor) and your card is immediately ready to study.</p> <h1>Studying</h1> <p>You can study in two ways:</p> <ol> <li><strong>Study session tab:</strong> Open a session in a new tab, then use the deck browser to pick what to study based on your vault hierarchy (screenshot one).</li> <li><strong>In-note widget:</strong> The widget detects flashcards in the current note and quizzes you in context. If you use folder notes, it can also pull in cards from all child notes if you are in a folder note. You can also choose to &#39;study all&#39; which allows you to study your flashcards across your whole vault (useful when multitasking in class – notes + flashcards side-by-side in one app).</li> </ol> <h1>Managing cards</h1> <p>There’s also a <strong>Flashcard Browser</strong> to quickly view, sort, and make changes to cards (screenshot five)</p> <h1>Scheduling</h1> <p>Scheduling uses <strong>FSRS</strong>, with settings for target retention and learning/relearning steps.</p> <h1>Feedback</h1> <p>I&#39;ve attached some screenshots. If you have any feedback or feature requests, I’d love to hear them.

I&#39;m curious what plugins would be recommended to do the following and what more experienced users would do for i) for a list (or string) of separate search terms in this case plant names, search and pull some number of images with google Api or something for each unique term ii) more advanced would be for a web page that contains a list of items like an online store, make a list that can be fed into item i. and then generate the images iii) bonus would be a plugin to find say a Wikipedia link if available and include some about of content from the opening paragraph</p> <p>Like I said I&#39;m quite &#39;green&#39; to Obs. and so if my use case misses the mark on this tool entirely be kind. I&#39;m here to learn and eventually pass on the learnings to others. Thanks for any support that can be given!</p> <p><strong>Update</strong> - Thanks for all the thoughts. As an example, I&#39;d like to take the following list and have it pull the first n number of images from google image to associate beside the unique name. This is all very easy to do manually and often wiser so as to discern search garbage but for sake of learning obs. I thought this could be a fun use case. *input: *Boswellia Sakura *Ariocarpus retusus *Dorstenia gigas burrata *Cyphostemma Multiple *Decarya madagascariensis *output: *Boswellia Sakura + 3 images + wiki entry matches *Ariocarpus retusus + 3 images + wiki entry matches *Dorstenia gigas burrata + 3 images + wiki entry matches *Cyphostemma Multiple + 3 images + wiki entry matches *Decarya madagascariensis + 3 images + wiki entry matchesz</p> <p><strong>Final update</strong> Lookd like the pluging Image Search is able to do what I need.

In Obsidian, the temptation to include any plugin that merely hints at potential benefits often leads to this problem. Obviously, the Obsidian veterans will repeat the mantra to keep Obsidian slim, only adding plugins when a serious need arises.</p> <p>But how you use Obsidian can also be a hidden death sentence for your vault. There are some methods that increase friction with scale. This is not a problem if your vault is limited in scope. But just take PARA (a folder system: Projects, Areas of Responsibility, Resources, Archive) as an organisational principle. While projects can typically be limited, areas of responsibility (e.g., marketing, content creation) are often ongoing efforts to maintain a standard. Typically, the resources folder becomes a mess, and over time, your archive folder will be even worse. Over time, the last two areas will bloat and become increasingly annoying.</p> <p>The core idea is to look for parts of the system that will impose increasing friction as scale increases. Whenever this is the case, you effectively create a breaking point, depending on scale, friction, and your friction tolerance.</p> <p><a href=\"https://zettelkasten.de/posts/the-friction-fallacy/\">I wrote an article</a> that applies this problem to the Zettelkasten Method for obvious reasons. But I also made sure to include the general principles and applied systems thinking in the article.</p> <p>I hope this article serves as a tool to future-proof your system against scale.</p> <p><a href=\"https://zettelkasten.de/posts/the-friction-fallacy/\">https://zettelkasten.de/posts/the-friction-fallacy/</a></p> <p>Live long and prosper<br/> Sascha</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/FastSascha\"> /u/FastSascha </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/ObsidianMD/comments/1q92ezt/frictionfragility_in_growing_systems/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/ObsidianMD/comments/1q92ezt/frictionfragility_in_growing_systems/\">[comments]</a></span>","_source_key":"reddit","ai_summary":"揭秘导致笔记系统崩盘的隐形杀手","ai_pain_point":"随着笔记库规模扩大，僵化的分类结构（如PARA）导致维护成本激增，迫使频繁推倒重来","ai_highlights":["避免在大规模笔记库中因分类过细而频繁推倒重来系统","识别并抛弃那些随时间推移会增加维护成本的分类法","在长期维护的任务中避开僵化且高维护成本的文件夹结构"],"ai_comment":"以为套个PARA就能成神？别让所谓的'专业系统'变成你推倒重来的借口，少折腾文件夹，多写点字吧。","ai_tags":["避坑指南","知识管理"],"ai_score":8},{"source":"Reddit","title":"Folders with folder notes on them aren't collapsing","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/ObsidianMD/comments/1q925m8/folders_with_folder_notes_on_them_arent_collapsing/","author":"/u/Vegan-Daddio","created_at":"2026-01-10T11:49:08+00:00","content_text":"<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>Using the Folder Notes plugin and whenever I click a folder with a folder note it expands as well.

I used a very simple technique - just write text to one big file named &quot;Journal.md&quot; in append-only style. It was a very simple approach, but it had some drawbacks.</p> <p>The file looked like this:</p> <pre><code>## October 25, 14:52 some text... ## October 25, 16:00 something happened here... </code></pre> <p>There were good benefits to it:</p> <ul> <li>it is very simple, just one file, you can easily copy it or send it somewhere via network. Easy to start writing to it in any editor: open file, jump to the end. Just generally simple to reason about</li> <li>easy to parse: it takes very little effort to write a script to, say, convert the whole journal to JSON (to process the data for whatever reason). Just split the text by the lines that start with <code>##</code>.</li> </ul> <p>But, having all the benefits, there were some critical problems with it:</p> <ul> <li>Obsidian links work badly with very long files: say you want to reference a specific header from &quot;Journal.md&quot; inside another markdown file, but for me it never worked, because when you jump to the link, the offset from the start of the journal is calculated incorrectly, and you jump to some other part of the file instead, and you have to scroll to the original header. Probably it happens when you have images in that file. There was a question regarding this issue somewhere on the Obsidian forum, but it seems like it was never fixed.</li> <li>even though writing to it is supposed to be easy (that&#39;s what a log essentially is, a data structure optimized for writing), in practice it was sort of hard both to read it and to write to it. Like if you use <code>## {date}, {time}</code> format, then it&#39;s easy to write to (you can even use something like Templater plugin but I never did that) but hard to find individual days and all the entries kinda blend together. And if you have a separate header per day, say <code># October 25\\n## 14:52</code>, then it becomes more readable, but you wouldn&#39;t be able to automate it using Templater, or QuickAdd. At least I don&#39;t really see how</li> <li>Sometimes when you open the big file, you need to scroll down a lot to get to the end. And I got stutters when opening the outline of this file.</li> </ul> <p>I wanted the writing experience to be very fast, because before using Obsidian, I wrote notes to my &quot;favorites&quot; chat in Telegram, and sending a message in a messenger is an instant action.</p> <p>And so a couple of days ago, I started using the core &quot;Daily notes&quot; plugin. Turns out it is a far faster approach for me, since I get all the stuff: it&#39;s fast to write to (click the button &quot;open today&#39;s note&quot;, start writing), it&#39;s easier to read and visually distinguish the days, and I don&#39;t really need the precise time for my note since it does not add any value to my notes when I read them to retrospect. And I can pretty much as well parse the notes if I wanted to, but with some precision loss (not a record per entry but per day, but I’m fine with it).</p> <p>I mean, &quot;daily notes&quot; is a default thing, maybe I could just use the defaults from day one🤷‍♂️</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/spaghetti_beast\"> /u/spaghetti_beast </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/ObsidianMD/comments/1q8zqd0/journaling_in_obsidian_going_from_onebigfile_to/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/ObsidianMD/comments/1q8zqd0/journaling_in_obsidian_going_from_onebigfile_to/\">[comments]</a></span>","_source_key":"reddit","ai_summary":"深度解析日记单文件模式的优劣，助你做出理性选择。","ai_pain_point":"日记数据量随时间增长，在单文件简洁性与多文件可管理性间难以抉择。","ai_highlights":["利用标题分隔符结构，编写脚本快速将日记转为数据格式。","单文件管理让日记在跨设备传输或迁移时极其简单直接。","打开文件直接跳转末尾书写，这种极简交互降低记录心理门槛。"],"ai_comment":"把日记写成JSON是为了训练AI替你上班吗？这波极客操作确实硬核，但文件大了你也别哭。","ai_tags":["数据极客","效率党必备"],"ai_score":6},{"source":"Reddit","title":"Trouble understanding how to use this app","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/ObsidianMD/comments/1q8zom2/trouble_understanding_how_to_use_this_app/","author":"/u/Arbeit69","created_at":"2026-01-10T09:18:33+00:00","content_text":"<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>Let me clarify.
