For the AI piece, should I go with Smart Connections or Copilot? Which one handles querying &quot;data&quot; (not just prose) better? Is there a way to visualize &quot;team health&quot; or &quot;weakest department&quot; stats within Obsidian, or am I better off exporting Dataview results to something else?

Please understand that I&#39;m **NOT** talking about listing all the notes that have that property. Currently I&#39;ve been able to list only the property values for each note that has that property using Bases, but since some notes have multiple values for that property, and multiple notes have a particular value, there is a lot of overlap. What I would like is, say for the `genre` property (of type `list`), to get the list as:</p> <p>- comedy</p> <p>- horror</p> <p>- romance</p> <p>- thriller </p> <p>And once I add a book with `action` genre, the list gets automatically updated to</p> <p>- action</p> <p>- comedy</p> <p>- horror</p> <p>- romance</p> <p>- thriller </p> <p>I&#39;ve seen a solution on the forum that uses Dataview ..., I was hoping something similar could be achieved with Bases?</p></li> <li><p>Similar to <a href=\"https://stephango.com/vault#folders-and-organization\">this sort of usage of daily notes</a> .... In my case, I want to create yearly notes that will be referenced by other notes. For example, </p> <p>- `{Book} was published in [[1914]]`</p> <p>- `{War} started in [[1914]]`</p> <p>These show up as backlinks to the yearly note. My question is, is there a way to convert these backlinks into reverse links on the note itself, organized based on a template? This would allow me to visit contemporary events from the notes in a better way, as I find using backlinks for navigation is rather clunky because it is disorganized (i.e.- I can only change the sort order, not group backlinks by file path). I&#39;d be willing to use a plugin for this, as this is more of a quality upgrade rather than a dependence. There might already be something that does this, I&#39;m just not sure of how to search for this functionality. </p></li> </ol> <p>Just for the record regarding community plugins- my rationale is to reduce my functional dependence on them as much as possible. So, I could use Dataview for problem 1, but I would prefer it a LOT if I could get it done with inbuilt features. All the community plugins I use only help me get things done faster- for example, adding underlines or removing all links from a paragraph with a keyboard shortcut- and I would like to not have the content of my notes depend on community plugins as far as possible.</p> <p>However, if a particular functionality is really necessary for me, I&#39;m not against using them.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/WeirdNingen\"> /u/WeirdNingen </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/ObsidianMD/comments/1r87x3b/is_there_a_way_to_organize_property_values_and/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/ObsidianMD/comments/1r87x3b/is_there_a_way_to_organize_property_values_and/\">[comments]</a></span>","_source_key":"reddit","ai_summary":"解决原生属性值聚合难题，自动生成不重复标签列表","ai_pain_point":"使用Bases查看多选属性时，因多笔记共享同一值导致列表大量重复，难以获取全部分类","ai_highlights":["自动聚合属性的唯一值，整理书籍流派标签时避免重复","新增属性时自动更新列表，维护动态分类索引时省去维护","不依赖插件实现值提取，偏好原生工具时保持轻量化"],"ai_comment":"还没装插件就想玩出SQL的去重效果，这是在逼强迫症发疯。","ai_tags":["数据极客","原生控"],"ai_score":7},{"source":"Reddit","title":"I'm confused where the line should be drawn regarding a centralized vault and a project specific vault.","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/ObsidianMD/comments/1r87qd4/im_confused_where_the_line_should_be_drawn/","author":"/u/chunky_lover92","created_at":"2026-02-18T16:31:42+00:00","content_text":"<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>New to Obsidian.

We’re always happy to help. </p> <p>A month later, that post crossed 1,000 upvotes, and I’m so grateful for the support! What makes me even happier is that I’ve barely seen any of those vague posts since. Most likely, new users found the post when searching for beginner help and realized how to ask better questions. That alone is a huge win. Thank you all for making that happen.</p> <p>The second post (<a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/ObsidianMD/s/dZcS2PAQXK\">https://www.reddit.com/r/ObsidianMD/s/dZcS2PAQXK</a>), about AI content, hit almost 1,500 upvotes! Even better, the admins actually listened and added an AI flair. Huge congrats to the author of that post! That flair now helps filter content that can sometimes be annoying as hell for certain users. And a sincere thank you to the admins for hearing us out and acting on it.</p> <p>All of this shows how unique our community really is. We come together, discuss issues openly, and actually improve things. And the developers listen. That matters.</p> <p>So thank you everyone. All newcomers with thoughtful questions, please keep asking, we’re happy to help!</p> <p>Keep writing. Keep building.

The problems I was trying to solve for myself:</p> <ul> <li>Simple to login</li> <li>Don&#39;t want to worry about storage limits/costs</li> <li>Cross device</li> </ul> <p>The plugin as of now does the following:</p> <ul> <li>Login through google oauth (two clicks)</li> <li>Select a remote vault or give it a name</li> <li>Start syncing (sync, force push, force pull)</li> <li>Client encryption (still brittle as of now.. Stabilizing the edge cases)</li> </ul> <p><strong>Cons I see:</strong></p> <ul> <li>While I dont have a problem with google oauth or drive, i am sure some would have issues in using them.</li> <li>It still needs the plugin to be installed first (unline the OG sync service from obsidian which is in-built)</li> <li>Live changes sync with multiple users on same doc - wont be possible with drive type storage systems. It will need a DB and that cant be provided for free.</li> </ul> <p><strong>Pros I see:</strong></p> <ul> <li>Files stay with your own account/storage</li> <li>If you ever expand your google storage - your obsidian uses the same!</li> <li>Allows for future features to share the documents or vaults with other google users</li> <li>Simple login = tend to use it more (i built another sync plugin earlier but with custom client id, secret key etc.. combination based. Was always hard to login and pull vault onto new devices because of things to remember)</li> </ul> <p><strong>Working on:</strong></p> <ul> <li>config sync (appearance, plugins(core+community), snippets, hotkeys)</li> <li>selective sync (exclude folder/file patterns, images, pdfs, videos, audio filters)</li> <li>stabilizing encryption</li> <li>testing large files, large number of small files</li> <li>conflict management</li> </ul> <p>There is not much for you to experience yet (Will be sharing the source soon).

These features were inspired by your feedback and suggestions from this amazing community. Here&#39;s what&#39;s new:</p> <h1>📅 Calendar Profile Selection</h1> <p>Thanks to a fantastic suggestion from a Capsidian user, you can now choose which calendar to add events to! Whether you want to separate work and personal calendars, or manage multiple project calendars, you can now select your preferred calendar profile right in the settings. No more manually moving events between calendars - just pick the right one from the start!</p> <h1>📝 Smart Append Locations</h1> <p>This is a game-changer for organization! When appending content to notes, you now have multiple insertion options:</p> <ul> <li>Append Last (default) - adds content to the end of the file</li> <li>Append First - inserts at the top of the file (great for daily logs!)</li> <li>Under Headings - append content under specific headings in your note</li> <li>Inside Tables - directly append to specific table columns (perfect for tracking data!)</li> </ul> <p>The app automatically detects all headings and tables in your target note and lets you choose exactly where the content should go.</p> <h1>🖼️ Adjustable Embedded Media Size</h1> <p>Tired of huge image previews from camera captures taking over your notes? You can now control the size of embedded images and videos! Set custom widths, heights, or both - choose from:</p> <ul> <li>Default no scaling</li> <li>Custom width (e.g., 400px)</li> <li>Custom height (e.g., 300px)</li> <li>Custom dimensions (e.g., 400×300)</li> </ul> <p>This is especially useful when you&#39;re sharing lots of images and want to keep your notes readable!</p> <h1>📊 Capture History Log</h1> <p>Ever wish you could see everything you&#39;ve captured? The new Capture History feature logs every single input you make - images, text, calendar events, voice notes, everything! You can:</p> <ul> <li>Filter by type (images, text, calendar, etc.)</li> <li>View by date range</li> <li>See detailed statistics with visual charts</li> <li>Click any entry to view full details or re-open in preview</li> </ul> <p>The logging runs in the background for all users, but the UI to view and manage your history is a Premium feature.</p> <h1>⚡ Experimental: Faster Obsidian Startup (Performance Boost!)</h1> <p>If you have a large vault, you know the pain of waiting for Obsidian to index everything before you can do anything. I&#39;ve integrated two experimental community plugins that can dramatically speed things up:</p> <ol> <li>Faster Open Note - Uses lazy loading techniques to open notes instantly without waiting for full vault indexing</li> <li>Faster Vault Load - Caches vault metadata so subsequent launches are lightning-fast</li> </ol> <p>You can enable these in the Performance section of settings. They&#39;re marked experimental, but I&#39;ve found them incredibly helpful for large vaults (1000+ notes). Both plugins are installed locally in your vault&#39;s .obsidian/plugins folder.</p> <h1>📁 Import ANY File Type to Your Vault</h1> <p>This was a highly requested feature! Previously, you could only share images to your vault. Now with Premium, you can import any file type - PDFs, zip files, audio recordings, spreadsheets, you name it! The app automatically saves them to your vault&#39;s attachments folder and creates the proper markdown links. Free users can still share images, but Premium unlocks unlimited file types.</p> <h1>🙏 Thank You!</h1> <p>A huge thank you to everyone who&#39;s provided feedback and suggestions. This community is what drives Capsidian forward!</p> <p>Let me know what you think of these features and what else you&#39;d like to see.
