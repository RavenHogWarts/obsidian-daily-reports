I am an undergraduate in History and have been using Obsidian to make my notes. I enjoyed its layout but I think I have not made the most of its plug-ins (core and communal).</p> <p>Here is an explanation of how I have organised my notes so far:</p> <p>Firstly, I have organised my readings into topics.</p> <p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/ohp5wcopj6cg1.png?width=1916&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d6ddf48a023acce61da27853683c0d15cdc49107\">https://preview.redd.it/ohp5wcopj6cg1.png?width=1916&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d6ddf48a023acce61da27853683c0d15cdc49107</a></p> <p>Here is probably where I have not organised the best! Once you open a specific reading, my notes are pretty standard, as I would have done in Word and such when I began my degree.</p> <p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/ttgbbeb3k6cg1.png?width=863&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f3fa62cd12b96dee3048cfb34bd4dd733d3ba8dd\">https://preview.redd.it/ttgbbeb3k6cg1.png?width=863&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f3fa62cd12b96dee3048cfb34bd4dd733d3ba8dd</a></p> <p>Many of my readings are really valuable and I want to find a way to memorise them. I could make flashcards on an external app, however, I am interested in how others have/may approach such a format of notes into a (likely laborious, but necessary) process of organisation that is efficient.</p> <p>I have had some thoughts:</p> <ul> <li>From my understanding of the spaced repetition plugin, I can restructure my notes so that a dividing &#39;?&#39; can create question then flashcard between prompts. This is one thing I could do.</li> <li>There is certainly more work that could be done in thematising my notes. They are mostly separated by reading but could be organised conceptually (e.g. &#39;The &#39;maximalist&#39; arguments for late Anglo-Saxon statehood&#39; or &#39;The Domesday Book as a stabilising weapon for Norman relationships&#39;.</li> </ul> <p>I know this is a very vague request for advice but I am keen to hear how others suggest, through their experiences, the potential to take my notes from its preliminary stages to maximising my learning.</p> <p>Thanks!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/LuminousDesigns\"> /u/LuminousDesigns </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/ObsidianMD/comments/1q7mb0k/i_am_looking_for_advice_on_how_i_can_organise_my/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/ObsidianMD/comments/1q7mb0k/i_am_looking_for_advice_on_how_i_can_organise_my/\">[comments]</a></span> </td></tr></table>",

Later, you realize that <strong>15 of them are about movies</strong>! not because you planned it, but because that’s what your mind naturally gravitated toward.</p> <p>At that point, you can simply gather those notes under one category and name it something like:</p> <p><code>1) 🍿 Movies</code></p> <p>Write first.<br/> Organize later.</p> <h1>1) 🍿 Movies</h1> <p>As for the folder naming structure:</p> <p>It starts with a <strong>number</strong>.<br/> The number itself isn’t very important, it’s usually there simply because it was the first folder.

To create more bridges that link clusters together. It’s a pattern-recognition and bridge-building game.</p> <p>Here are some pathways and bridges I have:</p> <ul> <li>The divorce of cute aesthetics from systematic violence in the commodification of Chiikawa as a sign of media illiteracy &gt; Suffering in &#39;Chiikawa&#39; vs &#39;Throne of Glass&#39; &gt; gothic vs romantasy &gt; The Possession of Alba Díaz &gt; Structural confinement of women</li> <li>My book cluster and my reflection on creating cluster are two clusters but the note on &#39;Word as bridge vs word as canva&#39; bridged the two clusters together.</li> </ul> <p>I connected a note about Chiikawa reflection from the colonialism framework to how gothic illustrates structural confinement of women. This is a very fascinating connection and isn&#39;t something I can see if I&#39;m putting my notes in my &#39;Notes&#39; app or if I&#39;m just writing them down in my notebook.</p> <p>Back to the title, so what do you call your game? &#39;Digital gardening&#39; Or &#39;Second Brain&#39;? Personally, I prefer &#39;Digital Gardening&#39; because:</p> <ul> <li>the vibes (hey it&#39;s a legit reason okay!) <ul> <li>it evokes a sense of peacefulness</li> <li>i like grounded vibes</li> <li>care and slowness</li> </ul></li> <li>it does not trigger productivity or hustle anxiety like &#39;Second Brain&#39; or &#39;Personal Wiki&#39; do <ul> <li>&#39;Second Brain&#39; &gt; storage + optimization</li> </ul></li> <li>it&#39;s a very concrete and vivid imagery</li> <li>it gamifies the system</li> <li>ease of communication</li> <li>it takes a few sentences to explain what this hobby (?) actually is. <ul> <li>And it does sound like an activity (compared to &#39;Second Brain&#39;)</li> <li>easy of mentioning in small talks (Can you imagine saying &#39;Oh my hobby is Cabinet of Curiosity&#39;???)</li> </ul></li> </ul> <p>However calling it &#39;Digital Gardening&#39; does not make sense entirely for m. While the name captures the nurturing aspect of the practice (planting a thought seed and letting it grow) it fails to name the part I find most exciting: pattern recognition and bridge-building across distant ideas.</p> <p>What would be a more accurate name?</p> <ul> <li>Bridge Builder (eh)</li> <li>Constellation Making (I guess it&#39;s okay)</li> <li>Bridgecraft (umm....?)</li> <li>Thread Weaving (vivid imagery but boring)</li> <li>Pattern Bingo (bestie I&#39;m not 80)</li> <li>Constellation Gardening (this is kinda fire?????????)</li> <li>Cabinet of Curiosity (cute)</li> <li>Meaning Alchemy (Hmmm I like this too.)</li> </ul> <p>Conclusion</p> <p>I&#39;m still sticking to &#39;Digital Gardening&#39; but I&#39;m eyeing &#39;Constellation Gardening&#39;.</p> <p>Context: I&#39;ve started Digital Gardening using Obsidian a few days ago.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/kaka1012\"> /u/kaka1012 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/ObsidianMD/comments/1q7h92x/naming_your_digital_gardening_game/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/ObsidianMD/comments/1q7h92x/naming_your_digital_gardening_game/\">[comments]</a></span>",

I use a combination of media db, BookFusion, and the web clipper to make these notes, so the metadata is mostly automatically (cover image is an external url). But I want to future-proof my vault, and store these cover images somewhere else. Things I’ve been thinking about:</p> <p>Outside vault: - Imgur: I have used the imgur plugin in the past to auto-upload images, but I feel like it’s on its last legs. - GoogleDrive: I managed to link to an image in a locally synced folder with file:///home/. Works great, but it’s an absolute path on my pc, so that wouldn’t work on my phone/ipad. I don’t find how I can link to image stored in my GoogleDrive with urls. - Dropbox, OneDrive, ProtonDrive: I supposed this would be similar to GoogleDrive. - Cloudflare S3: their free tier includes 10 GB and millions of actions, which would more than suffice for my use case. But I have no idea how to set this up, and I feel there might be easier solutions. - Setting up a small home server or even a NAS: I’ve been wanting to try this, but setting up and managing a server seems daunting (DNS, port-forwarding, and all kinds of things I don’t know anything about).</p> <p>Inside vault: - I’m currently paying for obsidian sync (mainly to support the developers), which has a limit of 1 GB storage. My vault size on my PC is 58 mb, but my obsidian sync storage usage is currently 593 MB/1 GB. I guess the tenfold increase has to do with snapshots and back-ups? But what worries me is if I start adding lots of images as attachments, my vault size will explode and become slow and sluggish to sync. I guess upgrading to Sync Plus would resolve this (storage increase to 10 GB), but it’s pretty costly for me. </p> <p>What I want is a simple set-up where I can store images that can be accessed by obsidian on my pc, phone, and iPad. Can anyone give me some pointers or advice?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Nihan-gen3\"> /u/Nihan-gen3 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://i.redd.it/cavc1yjmf4cg1.jpeg\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/ObsidianMD/comments/1q7athk/what_are_the_best_options_for_storing_many_images/\">[comments]</a></span> </td></tr></table>",
