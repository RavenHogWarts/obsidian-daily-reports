I didn’t know how to progress with a note.</p>\n<p>The note in question was this one - a commentary on Steph Ango’s <a href=\"https://github.com/kepano/kepano-obsidian\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">vault:</a></p>\n<pre data-code-wrap=\"md\"><code class=\"lang-md\"># Structure Can Be Found in Chaos\n\nAs a people, we have somehow come to assume that order is always the correct way to proceed. But, is that always true? \n\nLets take the example of Kepano's(Steph Ango) Obsidian vault. At first glance, looking at Kepano's vault it feel disorganised and chaotic. However, as you read through how he make's use of his vault, you start to notice something. Something quite interesting. \n\nWhat seems like chaos to an outside viewer, is a system. A system he has crafted with purpose\n</code></pre>\n<p>So I stepped away from it for a while.</p>\n<p>Then an idea came to me as I was watching the second season of The Sandman (I have read the comics before).</p>\n<p>What if the siblings could be used a vehicles for note processing?</p>\n<p>Then I want concepting. I went over four iterations of the idea before I landed on something that made sense. I won’t bore you with the details that whole process. In summary, it was taking what they represent and using it in the context of a note.</p>\n<p>But first…</p>\n<h2><a name=\"p-353327-who-are-the-endless-1\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"#p-353327-who-are-the-endless-1\"></a>Who Are The Endless?</h2>\n<p>They are anthropomorphic representations of the powerful natural forces they embody. Namely:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Destiny</li>\n<li>Death</li>\n<li>Dream</li>\n<li>Destruction</li>\n<li>Desire</li>\n<li>Despair</li>\n<li>Delirium</li>\n</ul>\n<p>How do they translate?</p>\n<h3><a name=\"p-353327-destiny-2\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"#p-353327-destiny-2\"></a>Destiny</h3>\n<p>Destiny is to do with what is already determined. This is where meaning is anchored. Here I ask:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>What is the larger idea?</li>\n<li>What constraints shape this note?</li>\n</ul>\n<h3><a name=\"p-353327-death-3\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"#p-353327-death-3\"></a>Death</h3>\n<p>Death deals with ends and beginnings. This is where the idea is distilled. I ask:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>What remains if everything else is removed</li>\n<li>What isn’t useful anymore here?</li>\n</ul>\n<h3><a name=\"p-353327-dream-4\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"#p-353327-dream-4\"></a>Dream</h3>\n<p>This is the exploration phase, where the idea becomes more than what it started as. I ask:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>What is this idea trying to say?</li>\n<li>What could this become, unconstrained?</li>\n</ul>\n<h3><a name=\"p-353327-destruction-5\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"#p-353327-destruction-5\"></a>Destruction</h3>\n<p>Here I deconstruct and dismantle. This is where I flip the note on itself. I ask:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>What assumptions does this rely on?</li>\n<li>How would this look if inverted or dismantled</li>\n</ul>\n<h3><a name=\"p-353327-desire-6\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"#p-353327-desire-6\"></a>Desire</h3>\n<p>This is about why the idea matters, why I am drawn to it. I ask:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Why am I drawn to this idea?</li>\n<li>What do I want the note to do ?</li>\n</ul>\n<h3><a name=\"p-353327-despair-7\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"#p-353327-despair-7\"></a>Despair</h3>\n<p>This is where the note breaks down. What I might not know, where I could be mistaken .I ask:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>What don’t I know?</li>\n<li>Where does this feel weak?</li>\n</ul>\n<h3><a name=\"p-353327-delirium-8\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"#p-353327-delirium-8\"></a>Delirium</h3>\n<p>This is where connections appear unexpectedly. What the idea reminds me of. Where I follow tangents, and link unrelated notes. I ask:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>What does this irrationally remind me of?</li>\n<li>What unrelated ideas collide here?</li>\n<li>If logic is suspended, what emerges?</li>\n</ul>\n<h2><a name=\"p-353327-how-i-use-them-9\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"#p-353327-how-i-use-them-9\"></a>How I Use Them</h2>\n<p>The first and foremost thing is to write, unfiltered, get all of it down. In most instances this is enough. I don’t always need the siblings. It is when I reach a friction point that I introduce them. They are not subheading, they are not sections, they are helping me look at what I am writing from a different perspective.</p>\n<p>I add this comment to the bottom of the note that’s giving me trouble as reference and explore different pathways.</p>\n<pre data-code-wrap=\"md\"><code class=\"lang-md\">&lt;!--  📜Destiny: context, lineage, constraints may emerge here --&gt;\n\n&lt;!-- 🌑 Dream: meaning, metaphor, implication --&gt;\n\n&lt;!-- 🔥 Desire: why this matters to me --&gt;\n\n&lt;!-- 🌀 Delirium: strange links, sideways thoughts --&gt;\n\n&lt;!-- ⚒ Destruction: doubt, inversion, dismantling --&gt;\n\n&lt;!-- ⚠ Despair: gaps, weaknesses, unanswered questions --&gt;\n\n&lt;!-- ⚰️ Death: distillation, closure, or release --&gt;\n</code></pre>\n<p>I don’t need all the siblings, 3 at most and that gets me out of my slump.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"p-353327-back-to-the-original-note-10\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"#p-353327-back-to-the-original-note-10\"></a>Back To The Original Note</h2>\n<p>When I had gotten the framework down, I brought into my the note. I took it through the lens of <strong>Destiny</strong> and <strong>Dream</strong>, which lead to likening Kepano’s vault to a forest where everything looks messy, but there is a complex system working underneath it all.</p>\n<p>This still didn’t feel right so I took the opposite look of <strong>Destruction</strong> and <strong>Despair</strong>, which revealed that abundance doesn’t always equate meaning. And how the system is only useful as long as Kepano can navigate it seamlessly.</p>\n<p>After all that I need to tie it all together, <strong>Death</strong> came into play and I concluded that order - what we call order - is not universal. And that how a system looks is less important compared to how easily information can be resurfaced.</p>\n<p>Doing it this way, I ended up with 3 additional notes that connect to this initial idea:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Chaos is like a forest</li>\n<li>Chaos can become a graveyard</li>\n<li>Order is an act of retrieval</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Lastly while reading through the note, <strong>Delirium</strong> came into play and I found connection to several other notes in my vault.</p>\n<p>This is an instance where I manged to make use of all the siblings by asking, what if… This isn’t always the case. As I said, <strong>3 siblings</strong> at most are more than enough. And only in instances when you are stumped on how to continue a note and feel it’s not quite ready.</p>\n<p>It is a perfect example of how having the siblings as a subtle guide can expand on an idea.</p>","_source_key":"english_forum","ai_summary":"面对笔记无从下笔时，借高手视角突破创作瓶颈","ai_pain_point":"撰写长笔记时陷入思维僵局，不知如何推进内容架构","ai_highlights":["笔记推进受阻时，借鉴高手逻辑打破创作停滞僵局","面对混乱笔记时，理解表面无序背后的内在系统","建立演进框架，解决长篇笔记撰写时的碎片化难题"],"ai_comment":"看着大师的 vault 发呆不如去追剧，毕竟灵感往往诞生于摸鱼时刻。","ai_tags":["心得分享","效率党必备"],"ai_score":6}],"github_opened":[{"source":"GitHub Open","title":"Add plugin: Live Columns","url":"https://github.com/obsidianmd/obsidian-releases/pull/9698","author":"nhiwentwest","created_at":"2026-01-21T18:09:14Z","body":"# I am submitting a new Community Plugin\r\n\r\n- [x] I attest that I have done my best to deliver a high-quality plugin, am proud of the code I have written, and would recommend it to others.

What would you suggest?</p> <p>—- </p> <p>Hi everyone,</p> <p>I’m currently experimenting with Steph Ango’s (Kepano’s) Obsidian vault structure and I really like the overall philosophy. I understand the separation between:</p> <p>- Categories for structural/navigation purposes (what kind of object a note is), and</p> <p>- Topics for thematic/semantic connections (what the note is about).</p> <p>Where I’m still unsure is how to handle what I would call “knowledge notes” — notes that contain extracted concepts or factual information from a book, but not necessarily my own original thoughts or interpretations.</p> <p>Workflow as I understand it so far:</p> <pre><code>• A book gets its own note in the References folder, using the book template with metadata (author, published date, etc.). • While reading, I document quotes, summaries, and notes inside that reference note. </code></pre> <p>Now the question:</p> <p>If I extract a concept or factual unit from that book (for example: “specific psychological concept A”) and want to create a standalone note for it:</p> <pre><code>• Which template would you use for that note? • Which category would it belong to? </code></pre> <p>It’s not really a “unique thought” - so no unique note or evergreen idea from me — it’s more like structured knowledge extracted from sources. I would link this note from the book reference note, but I’m unsure whether it should still be categorized as a unique notes or evergreen entry.</p> <p>One idea I had was introducing a separate category like “Wiki” notes for factual / encyclopedic-style knowledge nodes, but I’m not sure if that makes sens on the long run - therefore I would need to use the template in each of these wiki notes of a book (maybe 10-20) and the category note for wiki might get super messy in future.</p> <p>I know there is no right or wrong but I would love to hear your opinion.</p> <p>So I’d love to hear how others handle this:</p> <p>Would you treat these wiki as regular Notes without a template?</p> <p>Would you keep everything inside the Reference note until it becomes “your own thinking”?</p> <p>Or would you use a separate category or template for extracted knowledge objects?</p> <p>Looking forward to your perspectives — especially from people actively using the Kepano vault structure. </p> <p>Thanks!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/SenBlos\"> /u/SenBlos </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/ObsidianMD/comments/1qj88al/where_to_put_knowledge_notes_in_kepanos_vault/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/ObsidianMD/comments/1qj88al/where_to_put_knowledge_notes_in_kepanos_vault/\">[comments]</a></span>","_source_key":"reddit","ai_summary":"Kepano 模板下知识笔记的归类难题解答","ai_pain_point":"在使用 Kepano 模板时，无法区分源自书籍的知识笔记与常青笔记，导致文件归集逻辑混乱。","ai_highlights":["厘清分类与主题逻辑，归档书籍衍生知识时不再纠结。","明确知识笔记定位，维护常青笔记库时避免臃肿杂乱。","完善 Kepano 结构，整理提取的概念笔记时有处安放。"],"ai_comment":"为了给书里摘抄的一句话找房子，你们甚至快成了哲学家。","ai_tags":["学术党福音","效率党必备"],"ai_score":7},{"source":"Reddit","title":"Prompt to Normalize AI-produced Markdown for Obsidian","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/ObsidianMD/comments/1qj7umk/prompt_to_normalize_aiproduced_markdown_for/","author":"/u/pbeens","created_at":"2026-01-21T19:37:14+00:00","content_text":"<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>I’ve created a GitHub repository that documents a prompt I use to fix and normalize AI-generated Markdown for Obsidian.</p> <p>If you’ve pasted long output from ChatGPT, Gemini, Grok, or Perplexity into Obsidian and ended up with broken headings, code blocks, or tables, this prompt targets those issues.

Obligatory apology in advance, still new (and not particularly good) at this.</p> <p>Trying to make a glossary for myself and at a little bit of a loss as to how to format it. Here&#39;s where I&#39;m at so far:</p> <blockquote> <p>Every term in my \\glossary has its own note, often with aliases.<br/> The Virtual Linker/Glossary plugin links to each term&#39;s respective note (i.e., definition) whenever I write the term somewhere else in my vault.<br/> Terms are organized into subfolders and/or by tags.</p> </blockquote> <p>I like having a folder of all of the terms, and it&#39;s invaluable that I can hover over each term&#39;s virtual link and immediately see the entire note (i.e., definition). But I&#39;d also love to have a database where I can view and filter through all of them at once, like a dictionary. From what I can gather so far, there are two(ish) approaches:</p> <p><strong>Using Obsidian&#39;s Bases core plugin,</strong> I can have one column dedicated to the term, and another to the definition. The issue here is that I can&#39;t seem to display the note&#39;s content in the base, so I could put the definition in the properties instead; but that writes off any links between terms. (Also, the height of the columns in the base is fixed, so long definitions are obscured, but I might be able to fix that with a snippet.)</p> <p><strong>Using the Dataview plugin,</strong> a dataview table can display the list items in a note, so preceding each definition with a hyphen renders it visible without needing to alter the note&#39;s properties. However, it seems a little harder to filter and manipulate the dataview output when compared to the native base.</p> <p><strong>Using a Secret Third Thing,</strong> I could have the definition proper in the body of the note <em>and</em> the definition in the properties, albeit removing links and adding redundancy. I have a feeling there&#39;s a way to automatically populate the definition property with the content of the note (à la Meta Bind), but I have yet to figure out an elegant way of doing so. </p> <p>I can see that similar questions have been asked a few times, but it looks like the capabilities of native Obsidian have since expanded, and I feel like I&#39;m missing something obvious. I was curious about how you might approach it.</p> <p>Thank you! : D</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/lynxmeninx\"> /u/lynxmeninx </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/ObsidianMD/comments/1qiii2t/building_a_glossary_with_definitions_visible_in/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/ObsidianMD/comments/1qiii2t/building_a_glossary_with_definitions_visible_in/\">[comments]</a></span>","_source_key":"reddit","ai_summary":"别让词汇表只活在笔记里，把它们搬进数据库视图","ai_pain_point":"想像翻阅字典一样浏览术语，却被困在单条笔记的悬停预览里","ai_highlights":["自动链接术语，并在表格中像查字典一样筛选定义","告别只能悬停看定义，直接在一页内批量浏览所有条目","利用子文件夹或标签分类，让庞大的术语库井井有条"],"ai_comment":"还在把词汇表散落一地？学会这招，你的笔记库才稍微有了点“库”的样子，而不是垃圾堆。","ai_tags":["数据极客","效率党必备"],"ai_score":7},{"source":"Reddit","title":"I have ADHD, so I built a Roguelike inside Obsidian called SISYPHUS.
