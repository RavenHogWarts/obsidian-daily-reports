Version history, diffs, branching - all the good stuff. But getting git sync to actually <em>work</em> across devices turned out to be an adventure. I went through weeks of trying different approaches: Working Copy on iOS with manual pull/push routines, .git folder hacks, extra apps to bridge the gap, Apple Shortcut scripts… each solution worked kind of, but every single one had sharp edges and required way too many moving parts.</p>\n<p>At some point I stepped back and thought: why can’t my OG fileserver just do <code>git push</code> for me? Then I looked at the <strong>Remotely Save</strong> plugin, which already syncs to my file server. And I thought: what if I can just build another API interface for git?</p>\n<p>That’s how <strong>git3</strong> was born.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"p-356459-what-it-actually-is-2\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"#p-356459-what-it-actually-is-2\"></a>What it actually is</h2>\n<p>git3 is a small server (a single ~8 MB binary) that exposes an S3-compatible API. Behind the scenes, it stores your files as plain files on an ephemeral disk and automatically commits and pushes to a git remote on every change. It also periodically pulls, so changes made directly in the repo (say, from github interface) show up on your other devices too.</p>\n<p><strong>In short:</strong> Obsidian talks to git3 via Remotely Save thinking it’s an S3 bucket. git3 translates those S3 operations into git commits. You get seamless sync <em>and</em> full git history.</p>\n<p>Here’s what makes it different from other approaches:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><strong>No git client needed on your devices.</strong> Your phone doesn’t need to know git exists. Remotely Save handles the sync, git3 handles the git part.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Works on iOS, Android, desktop.</strong> Anything that runs Obsidian + Remotely Save.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Single binary or Docker container.</strong> No runtime dependencies, no system git installation required - just one binary.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Debounced commits.</strong> It doesn’t create a commit per file. it waits a configurable number of seconds after the last change, then commits everything at once.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h2><a name=\"p-356459-how-to-get-it-running-3\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"#p-356459-how-to-get-it-running-3\"></a>How to get it running</h2>\n<h3><a name=\"p-356459-step-1-prepare-a-git-repo-4\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"#p-356459-step-1-prepare-a-git-repo-4\"></a>Step 1: Prepare a git repo</h3>\n<p>Create a private repository on GitHub (or GitLab, Gitea, etc.) for your vault. If you already have one - perfect, use that.</p>\n<p>You’ll need a <strong>Personal Access Token</strong> with write access to the repo:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p>Go to GitHub → Fine-grained tokens</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Give it a name like <code>git3</code></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Under <strong>Repository access</strong>, select “Only select repositories” → pick your vault repo</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Under <strong>Permissions → Repository permissions</strong>, set <strong>Contents</strong> to <strong>Read and write</strong></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Generate and copy the token</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<h3><a name=\"p-356459-step-2-deploy-git3-5\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"#p-356459-step-2-deploy-git3-5\"></a>Step 2: Deploy git3</h3>\n<p><strong>Docker Compose:</strong></p>\n<pre data-code-wrap=\"yaml\"><code class=\"lang-yaml\">services:\n  git3:\n    image: ghcr.io/0xa1bed0/git3:latest\n    container_name: git3\n    restart: unless-stopped\n    environment:\n      - ACCESS_KEY=your-access-key       # make up any key you want\n      - SECRET_KEY=your-secret-key       # make up any secret you want\n      - BUCKET=vault\n      - REGION=us-east-1\n      - GIT_REPO=https://github.com/you/obsidian-vault.git\n      - GIT_TOKEN=github_pat_xxxxxxxxxxxx\n      - GIT_BRANCH=main\n      - DEBOUNCE=10                      # Git commit interval in seconds\n      - PULL_INTERVAL=60                 # Pull interval in seconds\n\n</code></pre>\n<pre data-code-wrap=\"bash\"><code class=\"lang-bash\">$ docker compose up -d\n\n</code></pre>\n<p>That’s it on the server side.

The README has step-by-step guides for <strong>Flyio</strong>, <strong>Render</strong>, and other hosting providers. You can literally get this running without spending a cent.

I edit notes on my Mac, my iPhone, my iPad and everything just stays in sync. Meanwhile, my GitHub repo has a clean commit history of every change. I can browse diffs, revert things, and generally have peace of mind that nothing is ever lost.</p>\n<p>This is my first time sharing here, so I’d really appreciate any feedback, questions, or ideas. The project is open source under the Elastic License 2.0 — free for personal and work use. Maybe someday I’ll build a hosted version for those who don’t want to maintain their own deployment, but I’m not sure it’s needed — throwing a single binary or tiny Docker container into random ephemeral environment somewhere should be easy enough.</p>\n<p><strong>Links:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><strong>GitHub:</strong> 0xa1bed0/git3</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Docker image:</strong> <code>ghcr.io/0xa1bed0/git3:latest</code></p>\n</li>\n</ul>","_source_key":"english_forum","ai_summary":"解决 iOS 端 Git 同步繁琐配置的方案","ai_pain_point":"在 iOS 设备上为了同步 Git 不得不折腾 Working Copy、快捷指令和各类黑科技","ai_highlights":["免去 iOS 端繁琐手动操作，解决跨设备 Git 版本管理断裂场景","告别 Working Copy 及快捷指令脚本，消除需人工干预的同步环节","无需修改隐藏文件夹或借助中转 App，应对移动端原生限制场景"],"ai_comment":"终于不用在 iOS 上为了个 Git 同步把自己折腾成脚本小子了，这简直是数字仓鼠的救星。","ai_tags":["数据极客","开发者向"],"ai_score":8}],"github_opened":[{"source":"GitHub Open","title":"Add plugin: Hide Tags","url":"https://github.com/obsidianmd/obsidian-releases/pull/10303","author":"marcantoinewilly","created_at":"2026-02-16T23:25:40Z","body":"# I am submitting a new Community Plugin\r\n\r\n- [x ] I attest that I have done my best to deliver a high-quality plugin, am proud of the code I have written, and would recommend it to others.

I wanted a high-quality, &quot;all-in-one&quot; system that looks stunning and handles everything from finances to task management. This is the result of my &quot;experience&quot; experiment.</p> <p>-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p> <p><strong>1. Advanced Finance System</strong> I’m turning 22 soon, and I’ve realized I need a better way to track my spending. Since I’m not naturally disciplined, I built a system that categorizes everything:</p> <ul> <li><strong>Income:</strong> Tracks Salary and Side Income.</li> <li><strong>Expenses (The &quot;Honesty&quot; Filter):</strong> <ul> <li><strong>Essential:</strong> Life necessities.</li> <li><strong>Optional:</strong> Debatable spending.</li> <li><strong>Waste:</strong> Completely useless expenses (this really shows where the money disappears).</li> </ul></li> <li><strong>Archiving &amp; Reports:</strong> When the month ends, the &quot;Close Month&quot; function moves all logs to an <strong>Archive</strong> folder (sorted by month/year). It generates a full MD report with total profit/loss, expense columns, and logs. Once archived, you can delete the raw transaction notes to save space without losing the report data.</li> <li><strong>Savings &quot;Piggy Bank&quot;:</strong> Deducts money from your main balance automatically when you contribute to a goal.</li> <li><strong>Live Exchange Rates:</strong> Powered by an API key to keep everything current.</li> </ul> <p>-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p> <p><strong>2. Web Integration (Syncing on the go)</strong> Obsidian isn&#39;t always convenient on mobile for quick logging. I built a simple <strong>companion website</strong> linked to GitHub.</p> <ul> <li>I enter a transaction on the site → it goes to GitHub → I click <strong>&quot;Sync Web Data&quot;</strong> in Obsidian → the Git plugin pulls the data.</li> <li><strong>Privacy Note:</strong> I use <code>.gitignore</code> to ensure GitHub only see the incoming data, not my personal notes.</li> </ul> <p>-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p> <p><strong>3. Visual Tasks Dashboard</strong> A streamlined task manager with dynamic color-coding based on deadlines:</p> <ul> <li><strong>Red Glow:</strong> Expired or &lt; 2 days left.</li> <li><strong>Yellow:</strong> 3 to 7 days left.</li> <li><strong>Green:</strong> Over 10 days left.</li> <li><strong>Neutral:</strong> More than 2 weeks out. You can also group tasks instantly using hashtags (e.g., #work, #project).</li> </ul> <p><strong>Technical Details</strong> If you think this is bloated with plugins, you’d be surprised:</p> <ul> <li><strong>DataviewJS:</strong> Doing 95% of the heavy lifting.</li> <li><strong>Obsidian Git:</strong> Only for the web-sync button.</li> <li><strong>Snippets:</strong> Only 3 CSS snippets used for this specific layout (though I have 19+ in total for other UI tweaks).</li> </ul> <p>This is only 2 out of 18 modules I’m developing.

But the more I use it the more frustrated I grow with how cut off it feels from the rest of the world. For me, 80% of the time if I&#39;m writing something down its because I want to make it accessible to someone else. I am getting my thoughts down and organizing them so I can share them with another human being in a structured manner.</p> <p>Yes, I&#39;m well aware I could throw everything up on a repo and link someone to it, but respectfully I am not a psychopath, so I am not going to link my friends or coworkers to a repository of markdown files any time I want to share something with them. I don&#39;t want to pay for Obsidian Publish because it would kind of defeat the whole point if I end up back at yet another subscription.</p> <p>I&#39;ve tried the Share Note plugin, and its been the best thus far, but a lot of pieces break when using this, for instance, headings can&#39;t be collapsed despite the presence of the little icons next to them, and CSS Snippets are not brought in at all, which breaks a handful of things I use. It also requires re-republishing any time a change is made, and any notes linked within a note also have to be explicitly shared otherwise they won&#39;t function.</p> <p>Additionally, all of these methods just create a looking glass with no way for the viewer to interact, be it an edit or just placing comments. Hell, even <em>I</em> can&#39;t comment on my own text. This makes it feel like any time I&#39;m putting something into my vault its just going into an information black hole which will never reach anyone else.</p> <p>Is there any option for someone like me?

I have a 2021 macbook pro M1Max, had it since launch... since 2023 I&#39;ve had the 200gb icloud drive plan - notes works flawlessly, all my photos from my main iphone (15 Pro Max) are synced on the mac and on apple watch and on my other iphones.</p> <p>My problem is in finder. I want to use obsidian with icloud... that I&#39;m paying for... but any vault i create on my mac inside Icloud drive&#39;s official obsidian folder isn&#39;t seen by my phone. Nothing I ever upload on Icloud drive is. Not on the drive itself, not on desktop, not on documents... nada. (yes, i have the sync desktop and document folders setting enabled on both devices). I have enough space, great internet, both are running 26.3).</p> <p>Weirder still is that on my windows machine it works, icloud drive sees what i have on my iphone&#39;s &quot;desktop&quot; folder. Even on my macbook in safari if i go to the icloud drive website i can see my synced beautiful folders (including another obsidian vault I&#39;ve made on my iphone this time and added it to it&#39;s Icloud drive)</p> <p>I have been dealing with this since i got the 200gb plan in 2023, I gave up after a while but now I really want to get it over with. I must mention that I mostly live in Romania and we don&#39;t have an official apple store, we&#39;ve got a premium reseller (iStyle) with shit technicians - when I&#39;ve asked them why this problem happens they said it&#39;s normal for my mac&#39;s desktop and my iphone&#39;s desktop to not sync, and they told me to just get dropbox 😂</p> <p>I was thinking of copying all my photos on gdrive, cancelling icloud drive for a couple of days and then buying a plan again.
