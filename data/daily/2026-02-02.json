I use Obsidian to organize my notes for easier reference and review. Saving my notes manually is obviously tedious, and the current solutions I’ve seen typically need a secondary device like a laptop to work, cause iOS is sandboxed to hell.<br>\nI can’t bring my laptop with me, so if my laptop falls asleep at my dorm, I can’t wake it up until the end of the day. I wanted something self contained, relatively efficient, and doesn’t need me to jump through a lot of hoops. (I ended up jumping through a lot of hoops, but hopefully it’ll never happen again. (It probably will)) I found an iOS Shortcut somewhere (I think it was the Obsidian forums, I don’t recall where) that uses Dropbox and a shortcuts app to save stuff straight to your Vault from your folder. Link to original shortcut, gotta give credit to whoever made this: (<a href=\"https://www.icloud.com/shortcuts/2dece5a13c3a4d3380a9b34323f67d6d\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">https://www.icloud.com/shortcuts/2dece5a13c3a4d3380a9b34323f67d6d</a>) I use Noteful personally, which only works with google drive, so I had to figure out how to produce a workflow that works with that. I think I finally figured out a thing that works, so here it is, let me know if it’s got problems.</p>\n<p>Actual Important stuff:</p>\n<p>You’re gonna need 2 apps. <a href=\"https://apps.apple.com/us/app/filebrowser-professional/id854618029\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">FileBrowser Pro</a>, and <a href=\"https://apps.apple.com/us/app/toolbox-pro-for-shortcuts/id1476205977\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Toolbox Pro</a>.</p>\n<p>I’m certain there’s better (and Cheaper, in the case of FileBrowser) apps that’ll do the same thing, but those are the ones I use, cause FB Pro’s got good shortcut integration.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p>Get the apps, link your Google Drive to FileBrowser Pro in the settings.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Set up a sync task that copies the folder in your Google Drive you want to ”On Your iPad”. It’ll produce a FileBrowser Pro folder in your immediate storage that you can access and edit.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/obsidian-ipad-notes-self-contained-workflow-goodnotes-v0-lkhm57z8u3hg1.jpeg?width=2752&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=28105b7763bbf5263e44bd0ebefd2e32fa974f47\" title=\"Image from r/ObsidianMD - Should Look Like This\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\"><img src=\"https://preview.redd.it/obsidian-ipad-notes-self-contained-workflow-goodnotes-v0-lkhm57z8u3hg1.jpeg?width=2752&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=28105b7763bbf5263e44bd0ebefd2e32fa974f47\" alt=\"r/ObsidianMD - Should Look Like This|750xauto\" width=\"690\" height=\"285\"></a></p>\n<p>Should Look Like This</p>\n<p>(Not exactly sure abt which Overwrite setting is best but Overwrite if Latest or New hasn’t broken anything yet.)</p>\n<p>3. Make sure the structure of your Obsidian Vault matches the folder. Same names and nested folders, basically. I just copy/pasted from the FB P folder the first time.</p>\n<p>4. In the Toolbox Pro Settings, Bookmark a .txt file (Named time in the shortcut) that has a datestamp in it. I use ISO, specifics probably don‘t really matter for that one.</p>\n<p>5. Use this shortcut, edit the names to match your sync task, Time file, and folder names. <a href=\"https://www.icloud.com/shortcuts/c031aa9c1c494061bcf8d2336d765bae\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">https://www.icloud.com/shortcuts/c031aa9c1c494061bcf8d2336d765bae</a></p>\n<p>6. Test run it, make sure I didn’t do something wrong.</p>\n<p>7. Automate it by setting it to work at a time of your choosing, or when you close a app.</p>\n<p>Notes:</p>\n<p>- Don’t open Obsidian while it’s running, it won’t update the files you’ve got active.</p>\n<p>- This doesn’t work if your file has the same name as your folder, it’ll put it outside your folder instead of inside. Just add a hyphen or a date to the end or something.</p>\n<p>- It’s not livesync or 2 way, editing the pdfs in obsidian won’t change anything in your notes app. Probably kinda obvious but I’ll get that out of the way.</p>\n<p>- You can use this to save a specific subset of folders and ignore others, by naming a specific folder in the shortcut. Like, if there’s 2 folders, school and home, you can just take school and the stuff in that, by naming the folder school, and editing the text in the shortcut to match it. Just make sure to keep that /[name]/ format.</p>\n<p>- You can probably figure out a way to do it without Toolbox Pro, I just used it cos the last shortcut did, and in case I need to revert to my older clunkier version that uses Toolbox Pro Bookmarked folders. (Here, for Reference, it’s slow and doesn’t work well: <a href=\"https://www.icloud.com/shortcuts/51e420ea655f4541ad8c8e350e30ec99\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">https://www.icloud.com/shortcuts/51e420ea655f4541ad8c8e350e30ec99</a> )</p>\n<p>Hopefully this helps people in a similar situation to me. If it’s got issues or glitches, again, please let me know! I’ll see what I can do to help. (Disclaimer, this was very much trial and error. Fixing it will too. No guarantees lol)</p>","_source_key":"english_forum","ai_summary":"抛弃电脑中转，实现iPad手写笔记自动导入Obsidian","ai_pain_point":"iPad笔记软件受iOS沙盒限制，无法直接同步至Obsidian，常需依赖电脑中转","ai_highlights":["摆脱电脑依赖，在仅持iPad时也能完成笔记归档同步","通过快捷指令自动化，省去手动导出再导入的繁琐步骤","兼容主流笔记软件，统一零散的手写笔迹与PDF文档"],"ai_comment":"终于有人治好了iOS沙盒的绝症，不用背着砖头电脑到处跑也是一种解脱。","ai_tags":["效率党必备","学术党福音"],"ai_score":8},{"source":"Obsidian English Forum","title":"Free Public Beta: Email anything into Obsidian — instantly","url":"https://forum.obsidian.md/t/free-public-beta-email-anything-into-obsidian-instantly/110723","author":"culturepiano","created_at":"2026-02-02T13:12:22.126Z","content_html":"<p>Quick update on <strong>Email2Obsidian (v0.2.1)</strong> - and a big thank you <img src=\"https://forum.obsidian.md/images/emoji/apple/folded_hands.png?v=15\" title=\":folded_hands:\" class=\"emoji\" alt=\":folded_hands:\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"20\" height=\"20\"></p>\n<p>I <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/ObsidianMD/comments/1qhy0v8/free_public_beta_email_anything_into_obsidian/\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">launched Email2Obsidian nearly two weeks ago</a> on reddit and I need to give a big thanks to everyone who’s been beta testing and giving genuinely brutal but fair feedback.

I use Obsidian to organize my notes for easier reference and review. Saving my notes manually is obviously tedious, and the current solutions I’ve seen typically need a secondary device like a laptop to work, cause iOS is sandboxed to hell.<br/> I can’t bring my laptop with me, so if my laptop falls asleep at my dorm, I can’t wake it up until the end of the day. I wanted something self contained, relatively efficient, and doesn’t need me to jump through a lot of hoops. (I ended up jumping through a lot of hoops, but hopefully it’ll never happen again. (It probably will)) I found an iOS Shortcut somewhere (I think it was the Obsidian forums, I don’t recall where) that uses Dropbox and a shortcuts app to save stuff straight to your Vault from your folder. Link to original shortcut, gotta give credit to whoever made this: (<a href=\"https://www.icloud.com/shortcuts/2dece5a13c3a4d3380a9b34323f67d6d\">https://www.icloud.com/shortcuts/2dece5a13c3a4d3380a9b34323f67d6d</a>) I use Noteful personally, which only works with google drive, so I had to figure out how to produce a workflow that works with that. I think I finally figured out a thing that works, so here it is, let me know if it’s got problems. </p> <p>Actual Important stuff:</p> <p>You’re gonna need 2 apps. <a href=\"https://apps.apple.com/us/app/filebrowser-professional/id854618029\">FileBrowser Pro</a>, and <a href=\"https://apps.apple.com/us/app/toolbox-pro-for-shortcuts/id1476205977\">Toolbox Pro</a>.</p> <p>I’m certain there’s better (and Cheaper, in the case of FileBrowser) apps that’ll do the same thing, but those are the ones I use, cause FB Pro’s got good shortcut integration. </p> <ol> <li><p>Get the apps, link your Google Drive to FileBrowser Pro in the settings. </p></li> <li><p>Set up a sync task that copies the folder in your Google Drive you want to ”On Your iPad”. It’ll produce a FileBrowser Pro folder in your immediate storage that you can access and edit. </p></li> </ol> <p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/lkhm57z8u3hg1.jpeg?width=2752&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f48c948cff47af183ba9670dc00f87aae19a0f14\">Should Look Like This</a></p> <p>(Not exactly sure abt which Overwrite setting is best but Overwrite if Latest or New hasn’t broken anything yet.) </p> <ol> <li><p>Make sure the structure of your Obsidian Vault matches the folder. Same names and nested folders, basically. I just copy/pasted from the FB P folder the first time. </p></li> <li><p>In the Toolbox Pro Settings, Bookmark a .txt file (Named time in the shortcut) that has a datestamp in it. I use ISO, specifics probably don‘t really matter for that one. </p></li> <li><p>Use this shortcut, edit the names to match your sync task, Time file, and folder names. <a href=\"https://www.icloud.com/shortcuts/c031aa9c1c494061bcf8d2336d765bae\">https://www.icloud.com/shortcuts/c031aa9c1c494061bcf8d2336d765bae</a></p></li> <li><p>Test run it, make sure I didn’t do something wrong. </p></li> <li><p>Automate it by setting it to work at a time of your choosing, or when you close a app.</p></li> </ol> <p>Notes: </p> <p>- Don’t open Obsidian while it’s running, it won’t update the files you’ve got active.</p> <p>- This doesn’t work if your file has the same name as your folder, it’ll put it outside your folder instead of inside. Just add a hyphen or a date to the end or something.</p> <p>- It’s not livesync or 2 way, editing the pdfs in obsidian won’t change anything in your notes app. Probably kinda obvious but I’ll get that out of the way.</p> <p>- You can use this to save a specific subset of folders and ignore others, by naming a specific folder in the shortcut. Like, if there’s 2 folders, school and home, you can just take school and the stuff in that, by naming the folder school, and editing the text in the shortcut to match it. Just make sure to keep that /[name]/ format. </p> <p>- You can probably figure out a way to do it without Toolbox Pro, I just used it cos the last shortcut did, and in case I need to revert to my older clunkier version that uses Toolbox Pro Bookmarked folders. (Here, for Reference, it’s slow and doesn’t work well: <a href=\"https://www.icloud.com/shortcuts/51e420ea655f4541ad8c8e350e30ec99\">https://www.icloud.com/shortcuts/51e420ea655f4541ad8c8e350e30ec99</a> )</p> <p>Hopefully this helps people in a similar situation to me. If it’s got issues or glitches, again, please let me know! I’ll see what I can do to help. (Disclaimer, this was very much trial and error. Fixing it will too.

I wanted a way to import my highlights that felt as seamless as the <strong>Readwise -&gt; Obsidian</strong> integration, but <strong>completely free</strong>, local, and without monthly subscriptions.</p> <p>I couldn&#39;t find a workflow that fit my exact needs, so I decided to build my own.</p> <p><strong>Here is what the plugin does:</strong></p> <ul> <li><strong>⚡ Direct Database Import:</strong> It reads directly from the <code>KoboReader.sqlite</code> file via USB. No need to manually export text files or process them externally.</li> <li><strong>🔄 Incremental Sync:</strong> It supports incremental imports out of the box. If you highlight new passages in a book you&#39;ve already synced, the plugin appends the new highlights to your existing note without overwriting your previous thoughts.</li> <li><strong>📍 Accurate Context:</strong> It calculates the global percentage/progress in the book for every highlight, taking chapters into account.</li> </ul> <p><strong>🎨 The fun part: Custom Templates</strong></p> <p>This is the feature I wanted the most. The plugin includes a Jinja-like templating engine that gives you full control over how your notes look.</p> <p>You can configure your own templates using variables and conditional logic.</p> <p>For example, you can choose to only show a &quot;Note&quot; section if you actually wrote an annotation:</p> <blockquote> <p>{{text}} </p> <p>{% if annotation %} <strong>My Note:</strong> {{annotation}} {% endif %} </p> <p><em>— {{date_created|date(&#39;DD MMM YYYY&#39;)}} (Chapter: {{chapter}})</em></p> </blockquote> <p><strong>Available Variables include:</strong></p> <ul> <li><code>{{text}}</code></li> <li><code>{{annotation}}</code></li> <li><code>{{chapter}}</code> &amp; <code>{{location}}</code> (percentage)</li> <li><code>{{date_created}}</code></li> <li><code>{{title}}</code> &amp; <code>{{author}}</code></li> </ul> <p><strong>🔗 Where to get it</strong></p> <p>The plugin is open source.
