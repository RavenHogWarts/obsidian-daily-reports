# Obsidian Daily Reports Fetcher

A lightweight, automated tool to fetch and aggregate daily updates from the Obsidian ecosystem. This project is designed to run automatically via GitHub Actions to generate a daily snapshot of community activities in JSON format.

> ⚠️ Temporary Status
>
> Due to GLM API rate limits, the AI processing step in GitHub Actions is currently disabled.
> Data fetching and local manual runs are still available.

## 🚀 Features

- **Multi-Source Aggregation**: Fetches data from multiple key Obsidian community platforms:
  - **Official Chinese Forum**: "Experience Sharing" category.
  - **Official English Forum**: "Share & Showcase" category.
  - **GitHub**: New plugins and themes submissions (from `obsidianmd/obsidian-releases` PRs).
  - **Reddit**: Latest discussions from `r/ObsidianMD`.
- **Zero Dependencies**: Written in pure Python using standard libraries (`urllib`, `json`, `datetime`) to ensure fast execution and minimal setup.
- **Automated Workflow**: Integrated with GitHub Actions to run daily at **00:00 UTC**.
- **Structured Output**: Saves data as clean, structured JSON files in the `data/` directory.

## 🛠️ Usage

### Running Locally

1. **Clone the repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/YourUsername/obsidian-daily-reports.git
   cd obsidian-daily-reports
   ```

2. **Set up Environment (Optional)**:
   It's recommended to set a `GITHUB_TOKEN` environment variable to increase GitHub API rate limits.

   - On Windows (PowerShell):
     ```powershell
     $env:GITHUB_TOKEN="your_token_here"
     ```
   - On Linux/macOS:
     ```bash
     export GITHUB_TOKEN="your_token_here"
     ```

3. **Run the Script**:
   ```bash
   python scripts/obsidian_fetcher.py
   ```
   The script will generate a JSON file in the `data/` folder named `obsidian_daily_YYYY-MM-DD.json`.

### GitHub Actions

The workflow is automatically scheduled to run every day. It will:

1. Fetch the data for the **previous day** (UTC).
2. Save the JSON report.
3. Automatically commit and push the new file to the repository.

Current limitation:
- The `Run Daily AI Processor` step is temporarily disabled because of GLM rate limiting.

## 📄 Output Format
