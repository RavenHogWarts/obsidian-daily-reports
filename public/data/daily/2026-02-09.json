To solve my itch, I built Onyx, a highly customizable markdown editor that offers direct exports to Obsidian.</p> <p>It&#39;s still pretty early, but it supports:</p> <ul> <li>Full markdown support (with a live preview)</li> <li>One-click export to Obsidian</li> <li>Importing selections into Obsidian/editor</li> <li>Capturing the current page </li> <li>Export templates</li> <li>Endless customization options (themes, fonts, custom CSS, etc.)</li> <li>And so much more!</li> </ul> <p>Although there are numerous other web clippers out there, I really like my solution mostly because of the UI, customization options, and pleasant experience.</p> <p>Everything is local, and all code is open source. I&#39;d love to hear feedback from anyone who is interested in something like this.</p> <p>Link: <a href=\"http://tryonyx.vercel.app\">tryonyx.vercel.app.</a></p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/AccompIished_AIIod29\"> /u/AccompIished_AIIod29 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://v.redd.it/8392od0emjig1\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/ObsidianMD/comments/1r0imem/i_built_a_chrome_extension_to_take_sidebyside/\">[comments]</a></span> </td></tr></table>","_source_key":"reddit","ai_summary":"告别切屏，浏览器侧边栏直接写进 Obsidian。","ai_pain_point":"阅读网页资料时需频繁切换窗口回 Obsidian 记录，打断阅读心流。","ai_highlights":["无需频繁切换窗口，浏览网页时侧边栏直接撰写笔记。","无缝衔接本地库，一键导出 Markdown 进行 Obsidian 深度整理。","适配个人阅读习惯，利用自定义模板与外观捕获网页选区。"],"ai_comment":"总算有个能打的侧边栏编辑器，不用在浏览器和黑窗之间反复横跳了。","ai_tags":["效率党必备","阅读伴侣"],"ai_score":8},{"source":"Reddit","title":"Homepage that automatically backlinks for tags?","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/ObsidianMD/comments/1r0hcta/homepage_that_automatically_backlinks_for_tags/","author":"/u/hereiiguess","created_at":"2026-02-09T21:35:09+00:00","content_text":"<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>I was wondering if there&#39;s a way to create a homepage for a tag that, when you tag a note with that tag, that note automatically backlinks to the tag&#39;s page.</p> <p>This is more for aesthetic purposes than anything, as I like being able to color code the dots by tag but I also dislike having notes/groups of notes that are individually floating around in the graph view and would love for them to all connect back to/revolve around a few large, main nodes.

Sending greetings all the way from Venezuela.</p> <p>I&#39;ve been using Obsidian for a while now and I realized that <strong>aliases</strong> are one of the most underrated features in the app. So I wanted to share a small script I wrote that makes creating them way easier.</p> <p><strong>Wait, what are aliases?</strong></p> <p>Aliases are alternative names you can give to any note. They live in your note&#39;s frontmatter (the YAML block at the top) and look like this:</p> <pre><code>--- aliases: - my alternative name - another way to find this note --- </code></pre> <p><strong>Why should you care?</strong></p> <p>Here&#39;s the thing — aliases are <strong>fully trackable properties</strong>. That means when you search for a note or try to link to it using <code>[[</code>, Obsidian will match against aliases too, not just the filename. So if you have a note called <code>Meeting Notes 2025-02-09</code> but you add an alias like <code>Project Alpha Kickoff</code>, you can find and link to that note using either name.</p> <p>This is huge for building a connected vault because it lets you locate any note through multiple entry points.</p> <p><strong>The script</strong></p> <p>I wrote a small JS script that takes whatever text you have selected in a note and automatically adds it as an alias in that note&#39;s frontmatter. It also truncates the text to 70 characters so your aliases stay clean.</p> <pre><code>// Script: Create Navigable Alias (truncated selected text) module.exports = async (params) =&gt; { const { app } = params; const activeFile = app.workspace.getActiveFile(); if (!activeFile) { new Notice(&quot;❌ No active file found&quot;); return; } const view = app.workspace.activeLeaf.view; const editor = view.editor; const selection = editor.getSelection(); if (!selection) { new Notice(&quot;❌ You must select text first&quot;); return; } // Truncate text to a maximum of 70 characters const truncatedText = selection.length &gt; 70 ? selection.substring(0, 70) : selection; await app.fileManager.processFrontMatter(activeFile, (frontmatter) =&gt; { if (!frontmatter.aliases) { frontmatter.aliases = []; } if (!frontmatter.aliases.includes(truncatedText)) { frontmatter.aliases.push(truncatedText); } }); console.log(`✅ Alias created: ${truncatedText}`); new Notice(`✅ Alias &quot;${truncatedText}&quot; saved`); }; </code></pre> <p><strong>How to set it up (step by step)</strong></p> <p>This script runs through the <strong>QuickAdd</strong> plugin. If you&#39;ve never used it, here&#39;s the full walkthrough:</p> <ol> <li><strong>Install QuickAdd</strong> — Go to <code>Settings → Community plugins → Browse</code>, search for &quot;QuickAdd&quot;, install it, and enable it.</li> <li><strong>Save the script</strong> — Copy the code above and save it as a <code>.js</code> file (e.g. <code>createAlias.js</code>). Put it somewhere in your vault, I recommend creating a folder like <code>Scripts/</code> at your vault&#39;s root to keep things organized.</li> <li><strong>Create a Macro in QuickAdd</strong> — Go to <code>Settings → QuickAdd → Manage Macros → Add Macro</code>. Give it a name like &quot;Create Alias&quot;.</li> <li><strong>Add the script to the Macro</strong> — Inside your new macro, click <code>User Script</code>, then <code>Browse</code>, and navigate to the <code>.js</code> file you saved in step 2. Select it.</li> <li><strong>Add a QuickAdd command</strong> — Back on the main QuickAdd settings page, type a name like &quot;Create Alias&quot; in the text field at the top, select <code>Macro</code> as the type, and click <code>Add Choice</code>. Then click the little ⚡ lightning bolt icon next to it to enable it in the command palette.</li> <li><strong>Use it!</strong> — Open any note, select some text, open the command palette (<code>Ctrl/Cmd + P</code>), type &quot;Create Alias&quot;, and run it. Done — the selected text is now an alias for that note.</li> </ol> <p><strong>That&#39;s it!</strong> Hope this is useful to someone. If you have suggestions or improvements I&#39;d love to hear them.

I didnt spend much time configuring anything, but the more I used it - the more I started to like it. I spent some time picking a theme, plugins, organising my folders, and recently even wrote some scripts to automate some things. However I started to realize that I just dont need all of these. For the whole 5 years I was using this app just to write something down, not for the power of internal links or anything like that. And it bothers me now.</p> <p>I really tried making use of the cool features - tried linking my notes together, applying tags, using metadata, daily notes etc. But it didnt click for me at all. I am a programmer and all information i need, like documentation, is available in one google search, so writing it manualy is not worth it for me and also can be error-prone. I also like making games, so sometimes write down small design documents or thoughts on other games, but all of these notes are one big wall of text that can&#39;t be splitted in multiple connected notes (or there is no need to). </p> <p>Every video I watched about this topic is someone writing an abstract philosophical quote in their daily note and I dont understand why anybody would do that and what it accomplishes. I&#39;ve seen only one good example - making D&amp;D campaigns. It&#39;s very clear why you would want that organized and linked together, but sadly I dont play it often so thats a miss. </p> <p>I really like the flexibility of Obsidian, and want to use its features, but I just dont know why. Any advice?</p> <p>EDIT: Thanks everyone for answering me! I think I already knew that I didnt need to use everything, but just needed to hear it from someone else. I think it&#39;s just the way I think and do things.
