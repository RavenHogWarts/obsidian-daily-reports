      "content_html": "<h3><a name=\"p-352017-tldr-1\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"#p-352017-tldr-1\"></a>TL;DR</h3>\n<p>I built Neural Composer because standard vector search plugins weren’t connecting the dots in my vault. It integrates LightRAG (a specific “flavor” of Graph RAG, faster and efficient) directly into Obsidian to give you answers based on relationships, not just keywords. It automatically manages a local LightRAG server for you (starts/stops with Obsidian), supports PDFs/DOCX, (and many others), and offers a hybrid search mode. Free and open source.</p>\n<h1><a name=\"p-352017-the-why-2\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"#p-352017-the-why-2\"></a>The “Why”</h1>\n<p>Hi everyone! <img src=\"https://forum.obsidian.md/images/emoji/apple/waving_hand.png?v=15\" title=\":waving_hand:\" class=\"emoji\" alt=\":waving_hand:\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"20\" height=\"20\"></p>\n<p>I’ve been using Obsidian for years to manage engineering projects, research, and personal journal. Like many of you, I hit a wall: my vault grew huge, and finding specific notes was easy, but synthesizing concepts across different notes was hard.</p>\n<p>I tried a Smart Composer plugin, which uses RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation), and I used a lot. It is great, but rely on simple vector search. If I asked: “How does the methodology in Paper A contradict the results in Project B?”, the AI often failed because the text chunks weren’t mathematically similar, even though they were logically connected.</p>\n<p>Recently I read about LightRAG and Knowledge Graphs and realized that was the missing piece. I wanted a graph that could “traverse” my notes to find those hidden connections.</p>\n<h1><a name=\"p-352017-what-i-built-3\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"#p-352017-what-i-built-3\"></a>What I Built</h1>\n<p>I’m an engineer, so I decided to build a solution (with the heavy assistance of my AI co-pilot). I forked the UI of Smart Composer (credits to glowingjade for the amazing base!) and completely re-engineered the backend.</p>\n<p>“Neural Composer” is the result. It’s a client for running a local LightRAG server that:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Builds a Knowledge Graph of your vault (Entities + Relationships).</li>\n<li>Manages the Server: I didn’t want to open a terminal every time I wanted to chat with my notes. The plugin auto-starts the LightRAG server when Obsidian opens and kills it when you close the app.</li>\n<li>Hybrid Retrieval: It combines local file reading (for precision) with global graph queries (for synthesis).</li>\n</ol>\n<h1><a name=\"p-352017-who-is-this-for-4\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"#p-352017-who-is-this-for-4\"></a>Who is this for?</h1>\n<p>I built this for my own needs, but I think it fits well if you are:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>A Researcher: Trying to synthesize literature reviews from a lot of PDFs.</li>\n<li>A DM/Writer: Needing to track complex lore and character relationships without manual wikis.</li>\n<li>Privacy Conscious: You can run this 100% locally with Ollama if you have the hardware (I use it with a RTX 2070 and it flies).</li>\n</ul>\n<h1><a name=\"p-352017-how-to-try-it-5\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"#p-352017-how-to-try-it-5\"></a>How to try it</h1>\n<p>It requires a bit of setup (installing Python and the library), but I tried to make the rest as “plug-and-play” as possible.</p>\n<ol>\n<li><code>pip install \"lightrag-hku[api]\"</code></li>\n<li>Install <strong>Neural Composer</strong> (Manual install from GitHub releases for now. Also you can use BRAT).</li>\n<li>Point the plugin to your lightrag-server.exe file.</li>\n<li>Right-click your notes folder → “<img src=\"https://forum.obsidian.md/images/emoji/apple/brain.png?v=15\" title=\":brain:\" class=\"emoji\" alt=\":brain:\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"20\" height=\"20\"> Ingest into Graph”.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>It’s open source. I’m not selling anything, just sharing a tool that solved a big headache for me.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://forum.obsidian.md/images/emoji/apple/backhand_index_pointing_right.png?v=15\" title=\":backhand_index_pointing_right:\" class=\"emoji\" alt=\":backhand_index_pointing_right:\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"20\" height=\"20\"> <strong>Repository &amp; Download:</strong> <a href=\"https://github.com/oscampo/obsidian-neural-composer\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">https://github.com/oscampo/obsidian-neural-composer</a></p>\n<p>I’d love to hear if this helps your workflow or if you find any bugs (it’s a v1.0, so be gentle!).</p>\n<p>Happy connecting!

How do you import your Kindle highlights into that specific note automatically instead of creating a new note?</p> <p>Kindle Importer Plus imports Kindle highlights from the HTML files exported by the Kindle app directly into existing notes. By specifying your book notes folder, the plugin matches the Kindle export to the note with the corresponding title.</p> <p>Example:</p> <ol> <li>Use the <a href=\"https://github.com/DuckTapeKiller/obsidian-book-search-plus\">Book Search Plus</a> plugin to create a note for &quot;The Trial&quot; by Franz Kafka, complete with frontmatter and cover imagery.</li> <li>While reading, record your highlights on your Kindle.</li> <li>Once finished, export the HTML file from the Kindle app and upload it to &quot;Kindle Importer Plus&quot;.</li> <li>The plugin identifies the note titled &quot;The Trial&quot; and appends the highlights to the end of the file. This ensures your existing content—such as personal reviews or summaries—remains untouched; the plugin only adds data to the bottom of the note.</li> </ol> <p>Alternatively, if you prefer the plugin to generate new notes for each export, you can enable this behaviour in the settings.</p> <p>This plugin is based on and extends the functionality of <a href=\"https://github.com/l2xu/kindle_html_importer\">kindle_html_importer</a> by <strong>l2xu</strong>.</p> <p><a href=\"https://github.com/DuckTapeKiller/obsidian-kindle-importer-plus/releases/tag/v1.0.0\">DOWNLOAD HERE</a></p> <p>Installation:</p> <ol> <li><p>Navigate to the hidden &quot;.obsidian&quot; folder located at the root of your vault.</p></li> <li><p>Open the &quot;plugins&quot; folder.</p></li> <li><p>Create a new directory named &quot;kindle-importer-plus&quot;.</p></li> <li><p>Copy &quot;main.js&quot;, &quot;manifest.json&quot;, and &quot;style.css&quot; into this new folder.</p></li> <li><p>Restart Obsidian or reload plugins to complete the installation.</p></li> </ol> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Delirious_Rimbaud\"> /u/Delirious_Rimbaud </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/ObsidianMD/comments/1qc6856/plugin_kindle_importer_plus/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/ObsidianMD/comments/1qc6856/plugin_kindle_importer_plus/\">[comments]</a></span>",

Now with Datacore being so new, I wanted to upgrade and play around with it. Well it turns out Datacore is frickin cool. I know .base views are very popular right now and I use those too but I can see Datacore becoming a big thing as people start to adapt it into their vaults.</p> <p>I&#39;ve included a group of components that can be used in .jsx scripts or ```datacorejsx codeblocks. I tried to be thorough with the documentation and examples as to make it user &quot;friendly&quot;. But really you can just feed the examples into AI and it&#39;ll be able to work it out.</p> <p>There is also a Theme Studio which is required for the components to work properly. Basically the Theme Studio allows you to map any color, gradient, image, or gif to the different elements of the components. For example you can set a bar background image, bar fill image, and clickable sprite with a pack of on-click animations that you select from. This system works for just about every part of every component and is applied globally in your vault as long as you&#39;re using the gloComponents (Global Components).</p> <p>The whole system works with the Minimal Theme by Kepano (haven&#39;t tested any other themes so idk). It also works with the Minimal Theme Settings and Style Settings community plugins. So basically you can make your own style settings themes -&gt; export them into the System/Themes folder -&gt; and the Theme Studio will see them.</p> <p>I wanted to do this because I have always like to make pinterest boards and have some kind of subtle moving elements like looping gifs in my vault (I know the examples are anything but subtle lol). So now you can make your vault as flashy or as subtle as you want. It really is a highly customizable theme system that turns your vault from bland to personalized.</p> <p>I know a lot of people see this as distracting, and it is. So why? Personally I feel more compelled to open an app if it looks good. I know it&#39;s kind of vain or petty but there&#39;s something about the &quot;feel&quot; of clicking a button that has hover effects and click animations and good aesthetics. So I wanted to create that compelling visual aspect in my vault and for me, it&#39;s working great.</p> <p>A huge shoutout to <a href=\"/u/Expensive-Moose-395\">u/Expensive-Moose-395</a> who was the first that I saw do something really cool with Datacore. <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/ObsidianMD/comments/1pr3w9o/an_interactive_nyan_can_progress/\">Original Post Here</a></p> <p>Also, obviously, Kepano the Obsidian Deity.</p> <p>All of the amazing artists that make my vault fun to look at.</p> <p>And of course the whole Obsidian community. ❤️</p> <p>I&#39;m still working on my personal vault using this system. You can find it the original post <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/ObsidianMD/comments/1q1ph2u/rice_af_my_forever_vault/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button\">Here</a></p> <p>Oh and btw. All of these components work on mobile. This is where I find things really useful. Especially when you start to design your dashboards. This makes using mobile feel really good and functional. For example all the girls see my vault and want to talk to me about it... lol. But actually it does make using mobile a lot easier when you design a good dashboard using these components.</p> <p>Oh and btw 2. Datacore is very fast. When you first load your vault it takes a second or two to load all of your notes. After that things are very snappy.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Spiritual_Flow_501\"> /u/Spiritual_Flow_501 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://v.redd.it/bddjstloa6dg1\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/ObsidianMD/comments/1qc1u0x/datacore_components_showcase/\">[comments]</a></span> </td></tr></table>",

      "content_text": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>Hoping for some help here. I think either a Dataview query I use, or else Templater plugin is failing me somehow.</p> <p>Basically, I have a template for notes I write when I come up with random story ideas. The template includes a &quot;Date&quot; field for the date I wrote down the idea.</p> <p>As part of the template I have a Dataview query that, basically, is supposed to find the previous dated entry in my notebook and link to it, as well as to the next dated entry (and report &quot;(none)&quot; when there is no previous or next entry).</p> <p>This setup was working flawlessly before: whenever I created a new note in my notebook, the previous entry would automatically link to it, and vice versa. But once 2026 hit, it&#39;s stopped working. Instead, in my new notes dated in 2026, I get an error.</p> <p>Here&#39;s the Dataview code (which I borrowed from elsewhere):</p> <pre><code>```dataviewjs /* previous/next note by date for Daily Notes Also works for other files having a `date:` YAML entry. MCH 2021-06-14 */ var none = &#39;(none)&#39;; var p = dv.pages(&#39;&quot;&#39; + dv.current().file.folder + &#39;&quot;&#39;).where(p =&gt; p.file.day).map(p =&gt; [p.file.name, p.file.day.toISODate()]).sort(p =&gt; p[1]); var t = dv.current().file.day ? dv.current().file.day.toISODate() : luxon.DateTime.now().toISODate(); // Obsidian uses moment.js; Luxon’s format strings differ! var format = app[&#39;internalPlugins&#39;][&#39;plugins&#39;][&#39;daily-notes&#39;][&#39;instance&#39;][&#39;options&#39;][&#39;format&#39;] || &#39;YYYY-MM-DD&#39;; var current = &#39;(&#39; + moment(t).format(format) + &#39;)&#39;; var nav = []; var today = p.find(p =&gt; p[1] == t); var next = p.find(p =&gt; p[1] &gt; t); var prev = undefined; p.forEach(function (p, i) { if (p[1] &lt; t) { prev = p; } }); nav.push(prev ? &#39;[[&#39; + prev[0] + &#39;|Previous Entry]]&#39; : none); //nav.push(today ? today[0] : none); nav.push(today ? today[0] : current); nav.push(next ? &#39;[[&#39; + next[0] + &#39;|Next Entry]]&#39; : none); //dv.list(nav); //dv.paragraph(nav.join(&quot; · &quot;)); dv.paragraph(nav[0] + &#39; ← &#39; + nav[1] + &#39; → &#39; + nav[2]); ``` </code></pre> <p>I&#39;m honestly not sure if it&#39;s Dataview that&#39;s failing, or the Templater. But the code is there in the new notes (along with my template YAML frontmatter)... it&#39;s just not doing anything.</p> <p>Incidentally, I also noticed that a separate Dataview query that is supposed to list every entry in my notebook in date order is printing the 2026 entries out of order... That query is:</p> <pre><code>``` dataview list from [[]] and !outgoing([[]]) and !&quot;Resources&quot; SORT date ASC ``` </code></pre> <p>This makes me <em>think</em> the problem is with Dataview, but I fear I&#39;m not quite smart enough to diagnose the problem.</p> <p>Thoughts anyone?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/thestephenwatkins\"> /u/thestephenwatkins </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/ObsidianMD/comments/1qbywcm/help_either_dataview_query_or_templater_is_failing/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/ObsidianMD/comments/1qbywcm/help_either_dataview_query_or_templater_is_failing/\">[comments]</a></span>",
