Live sync also trouble with.</p> <p>Let&#39;s say 2 phones android Install obsidian Have on couchdb 1 server admin and 2 users. Install live sync plugin </p> <p>To setup multi user must both phones first setup live sync using the server administration account and then change to the user? This totally not clear I got lots of issues but managed to solve it.</p> <p>Syncing works ok.</p> <p>But where to save like pics, videos, manuals etc. How to manage this using offline online situations? Do you only store small version on device and put video images jot in couch db but like in min.io? But what will happen if you offline view it?</p> <p>Second phase: If somehow my phone gets compromised the enemy can see all my .MD notes right?</p> <p>I don&#39;t see any protection or plugin&#39;s for this.</p> <p>What I found: I can install all on a work profile with android.

So how to secure this well?</p> <p>As example OneNote had secure notes where I must unlock some notes before see it..</p> <p>Why is such a basic data secure feature not in obsidian?</p> <p>To the gurus here how to maximum secure your notes?</p> <p>Data grow size: it&#39;s painfull that to have notes in obsidian all notes must be on the device right?

Instead of one long wall of text, it lets you grow your text as a tree of small blocks, attaching new blocks to any existing one, and expanding ideas by branching. It was perfect for early stages: outlining, brainstorming, and rough drafts.</p> <p>At some point I drifted back to more traditional editors and, eventually, to Obsidian for most of my writing. Obsidian already gives me everything around the text: research notes, multiple panes, plugins, and a comfortable long–form environment. I missed Gingko’s tree-like writing, but assumed it was just a separate tool I’d occasionally revisit.</p> <p>Then I saw a tweet mentioning a new Obsidian plugin called Branch Writing – and it basically brought the Gingko-style workflow directly into my vault. With it, you can flip a regular linear note into a visual, block-based tree and write inside that structure.</p> <p><strong>How Branch Writing changes the writing experience</strong></p> <p>Branch Writing turns your document into a set of blocks arranged visually as branches. Each block can be a paragraph, a section, or just a single idea; you can branch off any block, creating child branches to explore alternatives, deepen a point, or stash side-notes.</p> <p>Some things I noticed after a couple of days writing in this mode:</p> <p>Blocks are easy to shuffle. Reordering sections is as simple as moving blocks around, which encourages experimentation with structure.</p> <p>Parallel variants are trivial. You can keep several alternative phrasings or angles as sibling blocks, instead of stuffing everything into comments or duplicated notes.</p> <p>Focus is easier than in an outliner. It feels a bit like an outliner, but the spatial tree view makes it easier to navigate large drafts without losing the main thread.</p> <p>It still lives in Markdown. Under the hood, everything is Markdown in your vault, so you keep all the usual Obsidian benefits.</p> <p>It’s particularly nice at the planning and first-draft stage: you can quickly sketch a high-level structure, then zoom in on any branch and flesh it out, while keeping the rest of the tree in peripheral vision.</p> <p><strong>Practical details and customization</strong></p> <p>The plugin comes with a set of keyboard shortcuts for navigation and block creation, so you’re not forced into constant mousing around. There are options to tweak block width, spacing between blocks, and colors, which helps fit it into your existing theme and screen setup.</p> <p>The learning curve is surprisingly gentle: if you’ve used any kind of outliner or card-based writing tool, the mental model will feel familiar. What’s different is that you’re writing directly in the visual tree, not treating it as a separate view of some other document.</p> <p>I’ve already drafted a fairly large article entirely in Branch Writing, and the main thing I noticed is how much less I’m tempted to endlessly polish sentences too early. It nudges you to think in terms of ideas and relationships between them first, wording second.</p> <p><strong>Links and further exploration</strong></p> <p>Branch Writing for Obsidian (info &amp; download): <a href=\"https://ai.santiyounger.com/branch-writing\">https://ai.santiyounger.com/branch-writing</a></p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/maslakanton\"> /u/maslakanton </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/ObsidianMD/comments/1r332li/visual_writing_in_obsidian_branch_writing_plugin/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/ObsidianMD/comments/1r332li/visual_writing_in_obsidian_branch_writing_plugin/\">[comments]</a></span> </td></tr></table>","_source_key":"reddit","ai_summary":"引入树状分支写作模式，解决Obsidian长文线性构思痛点","ai_pain_point":"进行长篇小说或论文大纲构思时，传统线性编辑器无法直观展示分支逻辑，导致思维受限，且需在笔记软件与专业写作工具间频繁切换，打断心流。","ai_highlights":["树状分支可视化结构，辅助头脑风暴与小说大纲发散思维。","无需切换软件，在Obsidian内即可享受非线性块状写作体验。","将长文本拆解为独立卡片，降低写作畏难情绪并理清逻辑。"],"ai_comment":"终于不用在Obsidian和Gingko之间精神分裂了，这插件把树状思维强行塞进了线性编辑器，治好了我的大纲强迫症。","ai_tags":["写作辅助","效率党必备"],"ai_score":8},{"source":"Reddit","title":"Obsidian Copilot - Limit of the Plugin?","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/ObsidianMD/comments/1r32yry/obsidian_copilot_limit_of_the_plugin/","author":"/u/Big_Bike_7969","created_at":"2026-02-12T19:30:47+00:00","content_text":"<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>Is there a Copilot plugin forum where I should be asking this question? </p> <p>I&#39;ve been using Copilot for a few weeks now.

I&#39;ve set up an Index.md at the root so it knows the product context, and I&#39;m experimenting with separate context files for different purposes – things like a priorities.md that holds our current bets and constraints, and a user-segments.md so Claude doesn&#39;t need to be re-briefed every session.</p> <p>I&#39;ve seen people do really clever things with this pattern – daily rhythm files that define what to review on which day, preferences files that encode personal constraints (like dietary needs or business margin targets) so every output respects them automatically.

Do you have separate ones for different product areas or work types?</li> <li>How do you keep them up to date – manually, or do you let Claude write back to them at the end of each session?</li> <li>Has anyone set up different instruction files per folder – so Claude behaves differently when you&#39;re working in your research folder vs. your specs folder?

It uses databases to keep track of which recipes you can make with the food you currently have in your house. I thought I could replicate this by creating a note for each ingredient with a &quot;Need more?&quot; checkbox property and linking the relevant ones via an &quot;Ingredients&quot; list property. The plan was to use Dataview to show me the notes tagged #recipe where the notes listed as &quot;Ingredients&quot; return &quot;Need more?&quot; as false but I can&#39;t seem to figure out how to do it.</p> <p>The Notion template seems to use a formula that checks the length of the list of total ingredients against the length of the list of ingredients with the correct status, but the syntax seems to be slightly different, possibly because it&#39;s using a function that appears to be specific to relational properties. </p> <p>I&#39;m somewhat familiar with Javascript but all my attempts at teaching myself how to code have fell flat so it&#39;s possible the answer is really simple and I&#39;m just missing it.
