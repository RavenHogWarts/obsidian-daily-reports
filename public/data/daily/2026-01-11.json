to create folder/note. It may be too complex. Previously I was just using n/N, to create new folder/note. But one particular case usually caused problems with such approach: after creating a folder, you get focus on that folder, and if you want create another folder at the same level, you need to focus parent first, otherwise it will be created inside that new folder. So I decided to split bindings for files/folders.</li>\n<li>Visual selection. Initially I was using “J/K” to move and select. But after reading the forum, I noted that many of you want to have “move and preview in editor, without leaving file explorer” thing. So I decided to get it more priority by assigning “J/K” to these actions.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>I used a more basic version of this plugin for a few months, but just recently decided to rework it and release to the community, so it still may be unstable.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Please use a sandbox/testing Vault for initial testing.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I have more ideas for new features (e.g. other panes - Bookmarks, Search, Tags, Properties. Cut/Copy/Paste. Undo), but currently there is already a plenty of mappings, so I want to ensure it’s stable before moving on.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"p-351835-installation-4\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"#p-351835-installation-4\"></a>Installation</h3>\n<p><a href=\"https://github.com/denvolok/obsidian-sidebar-keyboard-navigation\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">GitHub repository</a>.</p>\n<p>As it’s not released(approved) yet for the community plugins repository, you can use the <a href=\"https://tfthacker.com/BRAT\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">BRAT</a> community plugin for installation and updating.<br>\nOr install it manually, by <a href=\"https://github.com/denvolok/obsidian-sidebar-keyboard-navigation/releases/latest\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">downloading</a>. directly from the repository.</p>\n<p>More description, demo and usage info in the repository.

I manage all my image assets in Eagle, but the workflow of getting images into Obsidian was tedious—find the image in Eagle, copy the path, convert to markdown syntax… I wanted to automate this, so I built it myself.</p> <p>Features: ∙ Search &amp; Embed: Search your Eagle library from within Obsidian and embed directly ∙ Paste/Drop Integration: Choose Eagle/Local/Cloud when pasting images ∙ Cloud Upload: Supports ImgHippo (free), Cloudflare R2, Amazon S3, WebDAV ∙ Batch Convert: Convert all local images in a note to cloud URLs with one command ∙ Cross-Platform Sync: Automatic path conversion between Mac and Windows</p> <p>About Cross-Platform Sync: If you sync your Eagle library via Dropbox/OneDrive/iCloud, you know the pain—file paths are different on Mac vs Windows. This plugin automatically converts paths to match your current OS when you open a note.</p> <p>Installation: Via BRAT: johnfkoo951/cmds-eagle Requirements: ∙ Eagle app running locally ∙ Obsidian 1.5.0+ Feedback and feature suggestions welcome.

It was such a big problem for me that I even temporarily switched to writing my stuff to Telegram instead. Things on mobile are supposed to be fast. But now we back.</p> <p>So the <code>./sync_android.sh</code> script looks like this: ```bash</p> <h1>!/bin/bash</h1> <p>sync_md_pull() { git fetch local files_fetched=$(git diff origin HEAD --name-only | wc -l | tr -d &#39; &#39;) git pull --ff 2&gt;&amp;1 &gt;/dev/null echo $files_fetched }</p> <p>sync_android_md() { git add .</p> <p>local commit_date=$(date +&quot;%y %b %d&quot;) local files_changed=$(git diff --staged --name-status | awk &#39;{print $1, substr($0, index($0,$2))}&#39; | paste -sd &quot;,&quot; - | sed &#39;s/,/, /&#39;) local num_files=$(git diff --staged --name-only | wc -l | tr -d &#39; &#39;)</p> <p>if [[ $num_files == 0 ]]; then local num_files_fetched=$(sync_md_pull) termux-notification --title &quot;nothing to commit bro💤&quot; --content &quot;yeah. and we pulled $num_files_fetched files.&quot; exit fi</p> <p>local commit_msg=&quot;☎️ at (&#39;${commit_date}) changed (${files_changed}) (${num_files} files)&quot;</p> <p>echo $commit_msg</p> <p>git commit -m &quot;$commit_msg&quot; git pull git push</p> <p>if [[ $? == 0 ]]; then termux-notification --title &quot;pushed bro✅&quot; --content &quot;$commit_msg&quot; else termux-notification --title &quot;error bro❌&quot; --content &quot;dunno check the logs $TMPDIR/obsidian_sync.log&quot; fi </p> <p>echo &quot;--------------------------------\\n&quot; }</p> <p>sync_android_md &gt;&gt;&quot;$TMPDIR/obsidian_sync.log&quot; 2&gt;&amp;1 &amp;</p> <p>echo &quot;syncing in bg... pid=$!&quot; ```</p> <p>basically the script runs <code>sync_android_md</code> function in background, saving the logs to a temp file (so that we could analyze it later if smth breaks). The function itself just calls git add, commit, and push, and also pulls before that. We call the func in background for speed (so that we don&#39;t wait for the slow git process), but we also use <code>termux-notification</code> to send a notification with the result of running the script.</p> <p>I also created a termux widget which runs this script. So the whole Obsidian sync process on my phone looks like this: write stuff, close Obsidian, and tap on the widget. The termux widget closes immediately and does stuff in bg, and I can check the notification with the command result whenever I want to.</p> <p>I also wrote a similar script for my Mac, and created an automation in Shortcuts so that whenever I quit Obsidian, it runs the <code>./sync.sh</code>. I will try to do a similar thing on Android when I figure out what automation options exist there.

It is the best way I have found to replicate that high-quality printed look (without spending ridiculous sums fonts). </p> <p>I’ve included support for the Style Settings plugin, so if you have that installed, you can tweak the a lot of the style without touching the code. </p> <p>Please have a play with it and let me know if there is anything I could improve.

Obsidian makes you manually fix links, which breaks delayed sense making. Obsidian has a stable future, don&#39;t like the future of LogSeq.</p> <p>I use Obsidian. I like Obsidian. I am committed to Obsidian. But Obsidian’s aliases system is genuinely painful.</p> <p>I started my note taking journey a couple of years ago with Evernote and then jumped to Obsidian, then moved to Logseq. I really loved Logseq. Unfortunately, due to lack of communication and the lack of confidence in the direction they were moving, I moved back to Obsidian full time. It has been almost a year since I returned.</p> <p>Daily journals and tasks are first class citizen in Logseq. I have made peace with most of the tradeoffs and have adjusted to not having a this workflow in obsidian.</p> <p>Block style notetaking was really good, but was not so important for me. So, it didn&#39;t need any sort of adjustment.</p> <p>But aliases in Obsidian still drive me crazy. Especially after LogSeq.</p> <p>In Logseq, I could brain dump freely in the daily journal. I would write naturally without thinking about structure, naming, or links. Later, when revisiting notes, I would simply select words and wrap them in [[]]. Done. Those words instantly became aliases for the same concept.</p> <p>In Obsidian, aliases syntax is completely different - [[filename|alias]]. In Logseq, both the actual filename and aliases, both has same syntax - [[original note]] and [[aliased name]] - Both of them refer to same page.<br/> While trying to alias anything, I do not have to decide canonical names upfront. Many times I do not even remember the original filename as well. </p> <p>My real problem is delayed sense making. Don&#39;t know if this makes sense to others or not.</p> <p>I dump a lot of information into my vault and only process it weekly but mostly after a month or so. I do not always know that two things are the same at the time of writing.</p> <p>Example - I might write notes about a dataset called “Amazon DSP” because that is what one team calls it. Weeks later, in another meeting a different team calls the same dataset “Amazon Media” dataset or whatever 100 names it has. The realization that these are the same dataset often comes much later.</p> <p>In Logseq, adding context like these is trivial. I go to any of these pages, add a new alias, and everything just works. All references automatically connect. Concepts from two different teams connect automatically.</p> <p>In Obsidian, this is painful. They do not retroactively unify concepts. Existing notes stay fragmented unless I manually hunt them down and rewrite links. This breaks the whole idea of organic knowledge growth for me.</p> <p>For me atleast, this is not a small annoyance. This hits at the core of how I think and how I process information over time.</p> <p>These are just two examples. I have many more, which is why I am ranting.</p> <p><strong>If anyone has figured out a genuinely simple and scalable way to handle aliases in Obsidian without rewriting half the vault, I would honestly love to hear it.</strong></p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/rjachuthan\"> /u/rjachuthan </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/ObsidianMD/comments/1qa04jb/rant_about_obsidian_aliases_delayed_concept/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/ObsidianMD/comments/1qa04jb/rant_about_obsidian_aliases_delayed_concept/\">[comments]</a></span>","_source_key":"reddit","ai_summary":"吐槽Obsidian别名需手动修复，阻碍概念重组。","ai_pain_point":"后期添加别名时，旧笔记中的链接无法自动重定向，需逐条手动修正，打断了知识整合的思路。","ai_highlights":["规避维护陷阱，在整理旧概念并添加别名时预知需手动改链。","明确功能短板，在进行知识重构时接受无法自动合并概念的现实。","评估迁移成本，在从 Logseq 回归 Obsidian 时适应交互逻辑降级。"],"ai_comment":"想要 Logseq 的智能又要 Obsidian 的稳定，这种“既要又要”的矫情，只能用手动改链来偿还了。","ai_tags":["进阶痛点","工具对比"],"ai_score":7},{"source":"Reddit","title":"I finally stopped treating my vault like a Wikipedia project","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/ObsidianMD/comments/1q9zegd/i_finally_stopped_treating_my_vault_like_a/","author":"/u/Fickle_Mud1645","created_at":"2026-01-11T13:31:06+00:00","content_text":"<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>I spent months obsessed with the perfect setup - linking everything, folders vs. tags, and trying to build this massive second brain that looked impressive but was actually exhausting to maintain.</p> <p>I realized I was spending more time managing my notes than actually thinking about them.
