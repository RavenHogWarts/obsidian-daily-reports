Drag in a note for context, ask it to restructure your project docs, or have it extract todos from meeting notes into your task list.</p>\n<p><strong>The free tier is actually usable.</strong> Core features—chat, file operations, semantic search, slash commands—all work with your own API keys. No markup, no usage limits from us.</p>\n<p><strong>Paid features I actually use daily:</strong></p>\n<p><em>Image input (Pro, $10/mo):</em> I photograph whiteboard sketches and book pages, drop them into chat, and ask Hydrate to transcribe or summarize into my notes. Sounds small, but it’s changed how I capture ideas.</p>\n<p><em>MCP integrations (Pro):</em> Connect external tools. I have it pulling context from our internal docs API during planning sessions.</p>\n<p><em>Custom views (Max, $20/mo):</em> This one’s wild. Describe what you want—“show my recipes as cards grouped by cuisine”—and it generates a React view on the spot. I built a project dashboard in about 3 minutes of back-and-forth. Views hot-reload as you iterate.</p>\n<p>If you like using Obsidian daily, I hope you will love using Hydrate.</p>\n<p>It’s an Obsidian plugin.

(make this a core plugin in the base so we can import a spreadsheet csv of properties easier.)</p> <p>Here&#39;s the general work flow once you have it installed:</p> <ol> <li><p>Make obsidian base with files and properties.</p></li> <li><p>Export CSV using obsidian base export csv function</p></li> <li><p>Edit CSV in spreadsheet editor. (important: multi list properties in csv are separated by comma. so a cell with 2 links looks like [[link1]],[[link2]] This is then formatted as a YAML property list when the updater app runs.</p></li> <li><p>BACK UP your files first just in case.</p></li> <li><p>Run sync updater app and your properties should appear updated in obsidian immediately. In sync app you select folder, file column name, and csv to import from.</p></li> </ol> <p>---</p> <p>I know it&#39;s python, but maybe someone can turn it into whatever obsidian neesd to be a plugin. i&#39;m not skilled in that. I&#39;m just a guy. Here&#39;s my latest script output from gemini:</p> <pre><code>### How This Works This script is a specialized synchronization tool designed to update Obsidian Markdown files using data from a CSV spreadsheet. It prioritizes data safety and intelligent formatting. 1. **Safety First Architecture:** * **Non-Destructive Read:** It reads your Markdown file and loads it into memory. * **In-Memory Edit:** It compares the CSV data against the file&#39;s metadata in memory. It *only* updates properties that already exist in the file (it won&#39;t pollute your files with unwanted CSV columns). * **Atomic Write:** It reconstructs the file (YAML Header + Markdown Body) completely in memory. It only opens the file for writing at the very last millisecond, preventing data loss if the script crashes during processing. 2. **Smart Pattern Recognition:** * It doesn&#39;t just split by commas (which breaks sentences). It uses a regex pattern to identify &quot;List Items&quot; vs &quot;Grammatical Commas&quot;. * **Splits on:** `Item 1, Item 2` (Comma + Capital), `Item 1, &quot;Item 2&quot;` (Comma + Quote), `Item 1, [[Link]]` (Comma + Bracket). * **Ignores:** `This is a sentence, with a comma.` 3. **Identity Matching:** * It matches CSV rows to Markdown files using a user-defined column (default: `Node Name`). It automatically handles filenames with or without the `.md` extension. ### User Guide **1. Prerequisites** You must have Python installed. Open your terminal or command prompt and run this command to install the required libraries: `pip install pandas python-frontmatter tkinterdnd2` **2. Running the Tool** 1. Run the script: `python obsidian_sync_safe.py` 2. **Target Folder:** Drag and drop the folder containing your Obsidian notes. 3. **Source CSV:** Drag and drop your CSV export file. 4. **Matching Column:** Enter the exact column name in your CSV that contains the file names (e.g., `Node Name`, `File`, `ID`). 5. Click **RUN SYNC**. **3. The Log** * **CYAN:** Information (Reading files, scanning folders). * **YELLOW:** File Modified (The script successfully updated a property). * **RED:** Error (Permission issues, missing columns, or read/write failures). --- ### Python Script ```python import sys import threading import os import re import yaml # PyYAML is installed as dependency of python-frontmatter import tkinter as tk from tkinter import filedialog, messagebox, scrolledtext # --- 1.

Shout out to Johan I know you’ll see this. </p> <p>I’m organizing my notes again this time with nested tags (as pictured) similar to Bear where they replace files.

I need most of those stories separated but easy to access. </p> <p>I really love the nested tags style of “drilling down” to the info I want and notebook navigator makes it so easy and visually pleasing. I know the same can be achieved in folders but I would certainly like to hear arguments for either or. </p> <p>The main thing I see for tags over folders is how INCREDIBLY easy it is to enter the tag string in the note in order to organize it.
