It started as a “scratch-my-own-itch” tool that enabled me to start using Obsidian as a regular daily journaling and task capture app in a way similar to how I had been using Logseq.</p>\n<p>I like to quickly capture tasks while note taking, with a task keywords that provides clear meaning TODO, FIXME, URGENT, etc., that stands out in context, and without needing to deal with typing special checkbox characters, specific tags, or opening a separate add task dialog.</p>\n<p>With v0.10.0 just released, I feel really proud of what this plugin has become, much more than what I initially envisaged for simple task capture and review tool. The initial community feedback has helped shape some powerful features with the advanced search, embedding tasks list queries in pages, and other usability and consistency tweaks.</p>\n<p>I hope that others enjoy it too. Not aiming to go head to head with the other popular task management plugins, but rather a tool that fits with a niche of users that find it fits their needs.</p>\n<p>Some key features and highlights:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Captures tasks from across your vault based on keyword matching (checkboxes optional).</li>\n<li>Honours the Obsidian settings to excludes files and folders.</li>\n<li>Styles tasks in the Obsidian editor with appropriate handling for the Live Preview, Reader, and Source views</li>\n<li>A master tasks list view with a powerful advanced search that follows a similar search syntax as the regular Obsidian search.</li>\n<li>Embed task lists in an page with options for specific search filter, sort, and visual styles and responsive layout.</li>\n<li>A powerful “Urgency” sort based on the Taskwarrior urgency algorithm that weights task priority based on multiple factors.</li>\n<li>For developers, the ability to detect task keywords in code blocks, with language specific handling to only collect keyword matches in code comments.</li>\n<li>Task syntax compatible with Logseq, making it easy to import Logseq markdown into Obsidian.</li>\n</ul>","_source_key":"english_forum","ai_summary":"拒绝繁琐格式，像Logseq一样用关键词快速记任务。","ai_pain_point":"记笔记时想随手标记任务，却厌烦输入特定复选框或打开侧边栏","ai_highlights":["记笔记时无需切面板，直接输入关键词即刻标记任务。","关键词在文本中高亮显示，阅读时一眼捕捉重点任务。","还原Logseq纯文本体验，让习惯该玩法的用户无缝迁移。"],"ai_comment":"终于有人把Logseq那套“硬核”纯文本玩法搬过来了，对复选框过敏患者的救星。","ai_tags":["效率党必备","数据极客"],"ai_score":7},{"source":"Obsidian English Forum","title":"New Plugin: Promptfire — Copy your vault's context to any LLM with one hotkey","url":"https://forum.obsidian.md/t/new-plugin-promptfire-copy-your-vaults-context-to-any-llm-with-one-hotkey/111088","author":"lxca","created_at":"2026-02-11T15:43:15.378Z","content_html":"<p>Hey everyone!</p>\n<p>I’m happy to share <strong>Promptfire</strong>, a plugin I built to solve a problem that’s been bugging me for a while: every time I work with an AI assistant on something inside my vault, I end up re-explaining my folder structure, naming conventions, frontmatter setup, and tag system from scratch. It’s tedious, eats tokens, and the AI still gets things wrong half the time.</p>\n<p>Promptfire fixes that.

For those who don&#39;t know, this was the method used by thinkers like Thomas Aquinas and Augustine.</p> <p><strong>The Problem:</strong> I found that my notes were becoming a &quot;graveyard of information.&quot; I had thousands of links but no real <em>synthesis</em>.</p> <p><strong>The Solution:</strong> I started structuring my core notes around the <strong>Dialectic Method</strong>. Here is how it looks in my vault now:</p> <ol> <li><strong>The Question (Questio):</strong> Every major note starts as a question.</li> <li><strong>The Objections (Videtur Quod):</strong> I am forced to write down at least two strong arguments <em>against</em> my current understanding. This ensures I’m not just in an echo chamber.</li> <li><strong>The Synthesis (Respondeo):</strong> Only after facing the objections do I write my own conclusion based on the evidence.</li> <li><strong>The Rebuttals (Ad Obiectiones):</strong> I go back and answer each specific objection.</li> </ol> <p><strong>The Result:</strong> My Graph View isn&#39;t just a mess of tags anymore; it’s a map of settled debates and logical connections. I call this my <strong>&quot;Cathedral of Thought.&quot;</strong> Instead of being a passive collector, I’ve become a &quot;Resurrector of the Scholastics&quot; in the digital age.</p> <p>It takes more time per note, but the retention and clarity are on another level. Has anyone else experimented with bringing ancient/classical methods into their PKM? I’d love to discuss how we can use these &quot;old&quot; tools for modern problems.</p> <p><em>Non progredi est regredi.</em></p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/lozerxD\"> /u/lozerxD </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1r1x947\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/ObsidianMD/comments/1r1x947/i_replaced_modern_notetaking_with_13thcentury/\">[comments]</a></span> </td></tr></table>","_source_key":"reddit","ai_summary":"拒绝笔记成坟场，用经院辩证法盘活你的知识库","ai_pain_point":"收藏了大量笔记和双向链接，却无法进行有效思考，知识库变成信息坟场","ai_highlights":["强迫以问题而非标题开启笔记，解决面对复杂学科无从下手的困惑","在笔记中预设强力反驳环节，避免单一视角思考导致的认知盲区","摒弃线性信息罗列，通过结构化辩论实现碎片知识的深度综合"],"ai_comment":"既然现代方法救不了你的“松鼠症”，那就试试老祖宗的辩证法，毕竟几百年前的经院哲学比现在的鸡汤更费脑子。","ai_tags":["深度思考","学术党福音"],"ai_score":8},{"source":"Reddit","title":"Obsidian Smart Export 1.2: New tree UI + backlink (incoming link) traversal + big performance upgrades","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/ObsidianMD/comments/1r1wokc/obsidian_smart_export_12_new_tree_ui_backlink/","author":"/u/ivan_dhs","created_at":"2026-02-11T12:57:56+00:00","content_text":"<table> <tr><td> <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/ObsidianMD/comments/1r1wokc/obsidian_smart_export_12_new_tree_ui_backlink/\"> <img src=\"https://preview.redd.it/z69xsgx23vig1.png?width=140&amp;height=87&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0d5dc51d4a5dad2b95148dbcd0352e4fcbfbe044\" alt=\"Obsidian Smart Export 1.2: New tree UI + backlink (incoming link) traversal + big performance upgrades\" title=\"Obsidian Smart Export 1.2: New tree UI + backlink (incoming link) traversal + big performance upgrades\" /> </a> </td><td> <!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>Hey everyone, I&#39;m the author of <strong>Smart Export</strong> for Obsidian and I wanted to share here the latest updates from the plugin.</p> <h1>What Smart Export Does</h1> <p>You choose a <strong>root note</strong> (usually your current note) and a <strong>depth</strong>, and Smart Export traverses up to that depth by following the wikilinks in that note, then the links in the next notes, and so on (BFS).

Include: - A one-paragraph summary of what was accomplished. - A bullet list of concrete changes (files created, modified, deleted). - Any open questions or follow-up items. - Frontmatter with `project`, `date`, and `tags` fields. Then append a link to that session note in the daily note. ## Formatting rules - Do not use emojis in journal entries. - Use plain, concise language. - Use markdown headings, bullet lists, and code blocks where appropriate. - Tag entries with the project name so they can be found later. ## What NOT to journal - Trivial or purely informational questions (&quot;what is X?&quot;). - Read-only exploration that produces no changes. - If the Code Journal MCP tools are unavailable or erroring, proceed with the user&#39;s task normally and mention that journaling was skipped. ``` </code></pre> <p>```</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/dickiedyce\"> /u/dickiedyce </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/ObsidianMD/comments/1r1vxq1/mcp_for_obsidian_cli/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/ObsidianMD/comments/1r1vxq1/mcp_for_obsidian_cli/\">[comments]</a></span>","_source_key":"reddit","ai_summary":"开发者福音，通过MCP将代码会话自动存入Obsidian","ai_pain_point":"编程结束后懒得整理开发日志，灵感转瞬即逝","ai_highlights":["通过MCP连接官方CLI，让AI直接读写Obsidian笔记库","自动捕获代码会话活动，生成结构化的开发日记笔记","利用VS Code提示文件，在编码环境无缝触发记录操作"],"ai_comment":"别再用拙劣的人脑记代码了，让MCP服务器替你干这种粗活。","ai_tags":["开发者向","效率党必备"],"ai_score":8},{"source":"Reddit","title":"Health.md v1.1.0 Release","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/ObsidianMD/comments/1r1vbch/healthmd_v110_release/","author":"/u/Bonteq","created_at":"2026-02-11T11:50:52+00:00","content_text":"<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p><strong>Github:</strong> <a href=\"https://github.com/CodyBontecou/health-md/releases/tag/v1.1.0\">https://github.com/CodyBontecou/health-md/releases/tag/v1.1.0</a></p> <p><strong>Website:</strong> <a href=\"https://healthmd.isolated.tech/\">https://healthmd.isolated.tech/</a></p> <p><strong>App Store:</strong> <a href=\"https://apps.apple.com/us/app/health-md/id6757763969\">https://apps.apple.com/us/app/health-md/id6757763969</a></p> <p>Got a fresh new batch of updates for ya!

This template corresponds to a specifically configured AI function and the necessary aspects for the particular task. The AI function is executed, and the result is inserted into the current document immediately following the selected text (for further editing or new generation). In this scenario, the following data elements can be used as input for the AI function:</p> <ul> <li>The selected text to which the AI function should be applied.</li> <li>The file name, which defines the &quot;topic&quot; or knowledge domain in which generation is required.</li> <li>The full content of the current file.</li> <li>The values of the aspects for the given task, defined in the Templater template code.</li> </ul> <p>By selecting the necessary information and generating new information through customizable templates, one can develop the &quot;knowledge&quot; described in the current document.</p> <p>More details can be found in the article (which also provides steps for installing and configuring the templates): <a href=\"https://github.com/ady1981/obsidian-templater-core-kbt/blob/583fc0e3f4a6daf40180cefc03ac57c85283b339/docs/getting-started.en.md#tooling-for-core-kbt\">Link</a></p> <p>I hope to get some useful feedback.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Adventurous_Speed632\"> /u/Adventurous_Speed632 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://i.redd.it/pwwzdp4xktig1.png\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/ObsidianMD/comments/1r1r6hx/aitemplates_for_obsidian_templater/\">[comments]</a></span> </td></tr></table>","_source_key":"reddit","ai_summary":"不用切屏，直接在笔记里调用 AI 生成内容。","ai_pain_point":"写作时频繁切换浏览器与 AI 对话窗口，来回复制粘贴打断思路。","ai_highlights":["选中即调用 AI，结果直接插入当前行，无需切屏复制粘贴。","预设结构化提示词，写作时一键调用特定功能，无需手动调试。","限定 AI 输出维度，处理复杂任务时避免模型跑题，直接拿结果。"],"ai_comment":"虽然模板满地走，但这套把 \"怎么问 AI\" 这个最烦人的步骤解决了。","ai_tags":["效率党必备","AI 集成"],"ai_score":8},{"source":"Reddit","title":"How do we make Obsidian into the ALL in ONE Tool?","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/ObsidianMD/comments/1r1lbe1/how_do_we_make_obsidian_into_the_all_in_one_tool/","author":"/u/ulcweb","created_at":"2026-02-11T02:40:45+00:00","content_text":"<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>A quick video throwing this idea out into the void, and seeing what other people think!
