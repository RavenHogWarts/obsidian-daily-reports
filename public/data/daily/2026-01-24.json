Native compatibility with Obsidian and other PKMs","url":"https://forum.obsidian.md/t/witral-a-self-hosted-ingestion-framework-whatsapp-markdown-drive-sync-native-compatibility-with-obsidian-and-other-pkms/110425","author":"kirlts","created_at":"2026-01-24T20:30:24.755Z","content_html":"<p>I built <strong>Witral</strong> to solve a specific bottleneck in my workflow.</p>\n<p>I found out about Obsidian a couple months ago, and I understood its potential. But I also knew that, personally, I wouldn’t consistently take the time to feed a “Second Brain” if it required me to stop what I was doing, open a specific app for it, and then write. That friction is small, but it’s enough to kill the habit for me after a week.</p>\n<p>However, I’ve been sending messages to myself on WhatsApp for years. Reminders, media to watch later, fleeting thoughts, because it’s the app I usually have open 24/7. I just needed a way to capture and structure that chaotic stream, so it would be ready for Obsidian or just to have it stored and organized somewhere else.</p>\n<p>Instead of pressuring myself to build a disciplined writing habit (which would be more than reasonable), I built this system so I would barely have to change my daily routine.</p>\n<h1><a name=\"p-353688-what-is-witral-1\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"#p-353688-what-is-witral-1\"></a>What is Witral?</h1>\n<p><em>“Witral”</em> comes from the Mapudungun word for <strong>“Loom”</strong>. It weaves the loose threads of your daily conversations into a structured fabric of knowledge.</p>\n<p>Witral runs as a lightweight Docker container on your server or local machine (Linux/WSL2). It connects to WhatsApp (via Baileys) and listens for tagged messages in specific groups to convert them into Markdown. It’s completely self-hosted, and easy to setup and manage through the provided scripts.</p>\n<p><em>Note on Safety:</em> You add the Witral bot to a group. Since Baileys is a third-party library, I strongly recommend using a secondary number or burner account for the bot to avoid any risk of your main number being banned by Meta.</p>\n<h1><a name=\"p-353688-how-it-works-2\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"#p-353688-how-it-works-2\"></a>How it works:</h1>\n<p><strong>1.</strong> I’m walking down the street with a friend and remember I have to order something later. In a monitored group, I send: ,buy USB-C adapter for the monitor. (The kind of thing I wouldn’t bother writing down anywhere else other than Whatsapp).</p>\n<p><strong>2.</strong> Or I send: <code>,,project_x,,bypass-idea Find a bypass for the Gemini API rate limits once core functionality is developed</code>, if I need to organize a more thought-out idea for a specific project.</p>\n<p><strong>3.</strong> Witral detects the <code>,,</code> separator at the beginning of each message.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>For the <code>buy</code> tag (configured in “Append Mode”), it adds the line to a single <code>buy.md</code> list, stored in the <code>Vault/tags</code> folder.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>For the <code>Project_X</code> tag (configured in “New File Mode”), it generates a new file named <code>bypass-idea.md</code> containing <code>Find a bypass for the Gemini API rate limits once core functionality is developed</code>, stored in the <code>Vault/tags/project_x/</code> folder.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><em>(Optional)</em> A built-in plugin then syncs these changes to my Google Drive automatically.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>You don’t need to SSH into your server to manage the bot:</strong> Sending <code>,,menu</code> in the chat triggers an interactive reply system, allowing you to add new monitored groups, create tags, or check system status directly from WhatsApp.</p>\n<p>This project started as a simple “WhatsApp-to-Markdown” script, but during development, I decided to turn it into a modular framework, for extensibility and because it’s cooler this way.</p>\n<p>Today it bridges WhatsApp to Local/Drive, but the plugin architecture allows expanding to other inputs <em>(Telegram, Discord Bots, etc)</em> or outputs <em>(S3, Github, N8N)</em> easily.</p>\n<p><strong>There are no AI components in Witral. The system deterministically captures exactly what you type.</strong></p>\n<p>I have it running 24/7 in a free-tier Oracle instance.</p>\n<h1><a name=\"p-353688-prerequisites-3\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"#p-353688-prerequisites-3\"></a>Prerequisites:</h1>\n<p>You only need <strong>Docker</strong> installed in a linux/WSL2 system. The included <code>start.sh</code> script handles the setup. For reference, I developed it entirely using Cursor IDE in Windows 11, running WSL2.</p>\n<p>I’m releasing it as completely open source. I’m not selling anything. The highest validation for me is simply seeing it being used by others who face the same friction I did.</p>\n<p><strong>Repo:</strong> <a href=\"https://github.com/kirlts/witral\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">https://github.com/kirlts/witral</a></p>\n<h1><a name=\"p-353688-quick-start-4\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"#p-353688-quick-start-4\"></a>Quick Start:</h1>\n<pre><code class=\"lang-auto\">git clone [https://github.com/kirlts/witral.git](https://github.com/kirlts/witral.git)\ncd witral\nchmod +x scripts/start.sh\n./scripts/start.sh\n</code></pre>\n<p><em>The</em> <em>start.sh</em> <em>script launches an interactive wizard allowing you to enable the Baileys plugin, linking your WhatsApp session (via QR) and setting up your initial groups/tags.

But I also knew that, personally, I wouldn&#39;t consistently take the time to feed a &quot;Second Brain&quot; if it required me to stop what I was doing, open a specific app for it, and then write. That friction is small, but it&#39;s enough to kill the habit for me after a week.</p> <p>However, I&#39;ve been sending messages to myself on WhatsApp for years. Reminders, media to watch later, fleeting thoughts, because it&#39;s the app I usually have open 24/7. I just needed a way to capture and structure that chaotic stream, so it would be ready for Obsidian or just to have it stored and organized somewhere else.</p> <p>Instead of pressuring myself to build a disciplined writing habit (which would be more than reasonable), I built this system so I would barely have to change my daily routine.</p> <h1>What is Witral?</h1> <p><em>&quot;Witral&quot;</em> comes from the Mapudungun word for <strong>&quot;Loom&quot;</strong>. It weaves the loose threads of your daily conversations into a structured fabric of knowledge.</p> <p>Witral runs as a lightweight Docker container on your server or local machine (Linux/WSL2). It connects to WhatsApp (via Baileys) and listens for tagged messages in specific groups to convert them into Markdown. It&#39;s completely self-hosted, and easy to setup and manage through the provided scripts.</p> <p><em>Note on Safety:</em> You add the Witral bot to a group. Since Baileys is a third-party library, I strongly recommend using a secondary number or burner account for the bot to avoid any risk of your main number being banned by Meta.</p> <h1>How it works:</h1> <p><strong>1.</strong> I&#39;m walking down the street with a friend and remember I have to order something later. In a monitored group, I send: ,,buy USB-C adapter for the monitor. (The kind of thing I wouldn&#39;t bother writing down anywhere else other than Whatsapp). </p> <p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/9lphd8lckcfg1.jpg?width=1080&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5172745b57ce06c6fb6843026ff2399549b451ee\">message added to buy list</a></p> <p><strong>2.</strong> Or I send: <code>,,project_x,,bypass-idea Find a bypass for the Gemini API rate limits once core functionality is developed</code>, if I need to organize a more thought-out idea for a specific project. </p> <p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/d2325z8dkcfg1.jpg?width=1080&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f457ae21145d18706878d122154de02300f059cb\">idea added to project x folder</a></p> <p><strong>3.</strong> Witral detects the <code>,,</code> separator at the beginning of each message.</p> <ul> <li>For the <code>buy</code> tag (configured in &quot;Append Mode&quot;), it adds the line to a single <a href=\"http://buy.md\"><code>buy.md</code></a> list, stored in the <code>Vault/tags</code> folder.</li> <li>For the <code>Project_X</code> tag (configured in &quot;New File Mode&quot;), it generates a new file named <a href=\"http://bypass-idea.md\"><code>bypass-idea.md</code></a> containing <code>Find a bypass for the Gemini API rate limits once core functionality is developed</code>, stored in the <code>Vault/tags/project_x/</code> folder.</li> <li><em>(Optional)</em> A built-in plugin then syncs these changes to my Google Drive automatically. </li> </ul> <p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/v88idvtekcfg1.jpg?width=823&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f340c4b2e31e3673da26ca63e3ec4e7647b7f093\">\\&quot;vault/tags\\&quot; folder content in Drive </a></p> <p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/ps8fqq3okcfg1.jpg?width=1600&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c5c74e98acfa72b169f96d1e725f6ff8512d060a\">Obsidian interface pointed to \\&quot;vault/tags\\&quot;, auto-synced to Drive without the need for Obsidian Sync</a></p> <p><strong>You don&#39;t need to SSH into your server to manage the bot:</strong> Sending <code>,,menu</code> in the chat triggers an interactive reply system, allowing you to add new monitored groups, create tags, or check system status directly from WhatsApp.</p> <p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/tk13hlm0lcfg1.jpg?width=1040&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5e586c652204df0f93426a5e10e9e5a50fda4eba\">interactive menu in action</a></p> <p>This project started as a simple &quot;WhatsApp-to-Markdown&quot; script, but during development, I decided to turn it into a modular framework, for extensibility and because it&#39;s cooler this way.</p> <p>Today it bridges WhatsApp to Local/Drive, but the plugin architecture allows expanding to other inputs <em>(Telegram, Discord Bots, etc)</em> or outputs <em>(S3, Github, N8N)</em> easily.</p> <p><strong>There are no AI components in Witral.

on the surface, but what are its shortcomings?</p> <p>First, relying entirely on individual developer development, unable to leverage the massive community plugins and themes.</p> <p>Second, at present extensibility seems limited, more like Notion than OB—you can&#39;t customize your habitual script workflows.<br/> (Most users actually don&#39;t master this ability... but now with AI it&#39;s different, which means often you only need to provide ideas, and AI can help you implement scripts or even plugins)</p> <p>And some limitations that may be inherent to the MD format still exist:</p> <ul> <li>Cannot embed code blocks in lists</li> <li>Cannot drag blocks (Notion-style operation)</li> <li>Cannot set aliases for internal links</li> <li>Haven&#39;t seen good outline functionality/floating table of contents yet, Obsidian can use NextTOC to achieve good floating outline functionality</li> </ul> <p>Overall, because it&#39;s like Typora where they write their own editing and rendering engine, there&#39;s no switching between &quot;editing mode/preview mode.&quot; For beginners, this is more friendly.</p> <p>Conversely, most Markdown symbols are hidden within the rendered formatting, and can&#39;t even be actively edited—this may have pros and cons for different users.</p> <p>This is very evident in &quot;Task Lists&quot; (tasks)</p> <p><a href=\"https://i.redd.it/bvm1selrpbfg1.gif\">https://i.redd.it/bvm1selrpbfg1.gif</a></p> <h1>Unexplored Parts</h1> <p>Because I haven&#39;t purchased the Pro version, there are many features I haven&#39;t tried yet.<br/> Such as AI functionality, and also that &quot;Views&quot; database feature that looks very similar to Bases.</p> <p>I only spent about 2 hours doing a rough experience, so please don&#39;t blame me if I wrote something wrong.</p> <h1>Summary</h1> <p>Actually, you can see that the &quot;good native editing functionality&quot; achieved by Octarine (for so-called &quot;note beginners&quot;—programmers can of course directly use source code mode and enjoy it), <strong>the vast majority can be achieved with appropriate plugins.</strong></p> <p>But the problem may also lie here—when a new user gets started, how do they know about these plugins?</p> <p>Unless seeing a detailed post like this, otherwise it will face nearly 3000 community plugins and fall into this rabbit hole.</p> <p><strong>And when you achieve these so-called functional optimizations, you may have already installed a long string of plugins.</strong></p> <p>I&#39;ve been using Obsidian for three or four years, I&#39;m an old hand in this field.<br/> But I hope those &quot;beginners&quot; can also more easily step into this land.</p> <p>Previous parts:</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/ObsidianMD/comments/1qlqced/my_autopsy_of_a_notionobsidian_app_onboarding_and/\">Onboarding and Editing (1/3)</a></p> <p><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/ObsidianMD/comments/1qlr155/my_autopsy_of_a_notionobsidian_app_views_23/\">Views and UI (2/3)</a></p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32;
