Modularizing all my notes into tiny chunks linked together has been game changing, but there&#39;s one element of world-building that I&#39;ve never quite figured out how to structure effectively.</p> <p>Here&#39;s a rough structure of my vault for context: - Campaign notes - Anything specific to a single campaign - World notes - Locations - All locations that currently exist everywhere - NPCs - Lore - Historical events - Religions and gods - Other factual stuff about the world</p> <p>Let&#39;s say I&#39;m running a campaign in my own world. It&#39;s set in the 4th Age and the entire campaign takes course over a few years. Easy, all my notes in the vault are written from the perspective of that time period: I have notes about the current state of the world (Everything in the Locations/NPCs folders), and some historical notes about past events (Ages 1 - 3, all in the Lore folder).</p> <p>Now however, I want to run my next campaign wayyy in the past, during the 2nd Age. All my notes about Ages 3 &amp; 4 aren&#39;t relevant, cos they haven&#39;t happened yet, and all my previous &quot;historical&quot; notes about the 2nd Age become current events. I have to elaborate on things that were previously in the Lore folder and being them into Locations and NPCs. But now those folders are a mess of things that existed in entirely different versions of the world, never together.</p> <p>I suppose my issue is I&#39;m seeing my notes as a &quot;snapshot&quot; of the world in whatever state my game is taking place in, and I don&#39;t know how to keep different &quot;snapshots&quot; together without just having separate vaults with duplicate information across them.</p> <p>How to authors usually handle this? If they write one book, then by the time the sequel comes around the state of the world has massively changed, do they just have an entirely separate series of notes for the world state in the second book? What happens to the information that didn&#39;t change, is it just duplicated across both?</p> <p>I&#39;d really love to see some examples of how people have structured their world building notes that deals with similar issues. Or maybe I&#39;m massively overthinking this and someone can make me see reason.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/rkfmckee\"> /u/rkfmckee </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/ObsidianMD/comments/1qslyh9/structuring_worldbuilding_notes_with_an_evolving/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/ObsidianMD/comments/1qslyh9/structuring_worldbuilding_notes_with_an_evolving/\">[comments]</a></span>","_source_key":"reddit","ai_summary":"D&D跑团中随时间演变的世界观笔记结构规划","ai_pain_point":"跑团世界随时间演变时，单一笔记难以兼容历史与现状，导致设定前后矛盾","ai_highlights":["分离战役与世界笔记，避免单次跑团污染通用设定库","规划时间线结构，解决同一地点在不同时代的描述冲突","模块化拆分设定碎片，通过链接重构动态变化的世界观"],"ai_comment":"跑团佬总爱把世界观搞得比现实历史还复杂，不过Obsidian确实适合这种自虐式的设定梳理。","ai_tags":["D&D跑团","知识管理"],"ai_score":7},{"source":"Reddit","title":"Any way to timestamp TikTok videos?","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/ObsidianMD/comments/1qslfjs/any_way_to_timestamp_tiktok_videos/","author":"/u/Awkward-Secretary726","created_at":"2026-02-01T02:04:00+00:00","content_text":"<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>Hey everyone 👋</p> <p>I&#39;ve been trying to find a way to share a specific moment from a TikTok video (like how on YouTube you can add <code>?t=30</code> to the link and it jumps straight to that second).</p> <p>I&#39;ve looked around both the app and web version but can&#39;t find anything built-in.
