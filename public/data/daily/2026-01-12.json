Has it been abandoned by the developer? Any replacement plugins if that&#39;s the case? I&#39;ve used Excalibrain. The only problem is that, as far as I am aware, Excalibrain supports only 3 hyrarchical levels (the parents of the selected note and it&#39;s children).

Especially across multiple Google Drive accounts for a small team of people. I&#39;d love it if by simply tagging things, we wouldn&#39;t need to move files across google drives so often and create multiple bases based on file tags/properties.

The moment I think it doesn&#39;t have a feature I need it turns out it does but in different fashion and more. BUT there is one thing it doesn&#39;t have which wanted me to maybe switch back to Notion. I dropped this idea quite quickly realizing how much I got accustomed to Obsidian and really like it. So I&#39;m talking about the fact that Notion is a web service so I can access it from wherever I want not having to install anything. I got now Obsidian set up to sync with my Google Drive across devices. My primary work is done on a machine where Obsidian is installed so I only need this online feature from time to time. So far I was simply using Notion to do whatever I wanted to do online and then copy back to Obsidian when possible but obviously it doesnt always work as I don&#39;t have access to vast array of files I got. So I started to ask if there is a different way - by simply accessing the files on my Google Drive directly with some third party MD editor or even a web service that would have access to my Google Drive. Has anyone done this like that? Any recommendations on the workflow or tools for online MD editing?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Final-Isopod\"> /u/Final-Isopod </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/ObsidianMD/comments/1qao9tk/online_editing_of_md_files_to_accompany_obsidian/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/ObsidianMD/comments/1qao9tk/online_editing_of_md_files_to_accompany_obsidian/\">[comments]</a></span>",
