This seemingly simple and inoquous feature makes Obsidian worth it for me. The problem I&#39;ve encountered, the insidious snake in my garden, is that it has grown more unstable and buggy. I wouldn&#39;t say it&#39;s unusable but it&#39;s getting there. I went to the developer&#39;s discord and didn&#39;t see much recent activity, and I believe the plugin was last update more than two years ago, almost three. Is Juggl dead? Has it been abandoned by the developer? Any replacement plugins if that&#39;s the case? I&#39;ve used Excalibrain. The only problem is that, as far as I am aware, Excalibrain supports only 3 hyrarchical levels (the parents of the selected note and it&#39;s children). For my studies I would need a lot more than that. Any guidance from this community will be profoundly appreciated.

I&#39;ve been wondering: - are each section a different note? - are the names of the notes the numbers (to keep track of not making two times the same number) - should I merge all the files in the end, to export as a pdf a single note?

BUT there is one thing it doesn&#39;t have which wanted me to maybe switch back to Notion. I dropped this idea quite quickly realizing how much I got accustomed to Obsidian and really like it. So I&#39;m talking about the fact that Notion is a web service so I can access it from wherever I want not having to install anything. I got now Obsidian set up to sync with my Google Drive across devices. My primary work is done on a machine where Obsidian is installed so I only need this online feature from time to time. So far I was simply using Notion to do whatever I wanted to do online and then copy back to Obsidian when possible but obviously it doesnt always work as I don&#39;t have access to vast array of files I got. So I started to ask if there is a different way - by simply accessing the files on my Google Drive directly with some third party MD editor or even a web service that would have access to my Google Drive. Has anyone done this like that?

Im now using Obsidian to worldbuild and have found ttrpgtutorials and his content which has helped a bunch with plugins etc. However most of his videos are before the latest run of D&amp;D 2024 and im using that as my base.</p> <p>I plan to use ObsidianMD to worldbuild, storyboard and also run my games.</p> <p>I own DND 2024 as physical and digital copies, but I really dont want to go through all of the hassle of copying and pasting everything into my vault. There-in lies my question.</p> <p>Is there a general resource hub that I can find these sorts of things? And is there a method to finding something like a DND 2024 compendium that i can copy into my vault to avoid the painstaking task of copying a textbook paragraph by paragraph and making sure all of the links are valid?</p> <p>Please be kind in your response, I am only one man 🙏</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Aborted_Plebeian\"> /u/Aborted_Plebeian </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/ObsidianMD/comments/1qalk49/dd_2024_resources_where_to_find_other_resources/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/ObsidianMD/comments/1qalk49/dd_2024_resources_where_to_find_other_resources/\">[comments]</a></span>"
