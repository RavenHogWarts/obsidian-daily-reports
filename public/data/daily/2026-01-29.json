Verify</h3> <p>Start a Claude Code session and ask it to take a screenshot or run a script:</p> <p>```</p> <blockquote> <p>take a screenshot of Obsidian run: app.vault.getFiles().length ```</p> </blockquote> <h2>What it can do</h2> <ul> <li><code>take_snapshot</code> — a11y tree of the current view (preferred over screenshots)</li> <li><code>take_screenshot</code> — pixel screenshot</li> <li><code>evaluate_script</code> — run JS with full Obsidian API access (<code>app</code>, <code>app.workspace</code>, <code>app.vault</code>, <code>app.plugins</code>, etc.)</li> <li><code>click</code>, <code>fill</code>, <code>hover</code>, <code>press_key</code> — interact with UI elements</li> <li><code>list_console_messages</code> / <code>list_network_requests</code> — debug output</li> <li><code>performance_start_trace</code> / <code>performance_stop_trace</code> — performance profiling</li> </ul> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/CoyotePrudent4965\"> /u/CoyotePrudent4965 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/ObsidianMD/comments/1qq0ilg/chrome_devtools_mcp_obsidian_unlimited_power/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/ObsidianMD/comments/1qq0ilg/chrome_devtools_mcp_obsidian_unlimited_power/\">[comments]</a></span>","_source_key":"reddit","ai_summary":"AI接管调试，Obsidian插件开发自动排雷修Bug。","ai_pain_point":"开发插件或主题时，需频繁在命令行和开发者工具间切换，报错排查耗时且繁琐。","ai_highlights":["开发插件时AI自动定位并修复顽固Bug，省去人工排查。","直接操控Obsidian DOM与API，无需切屏即可测试代码改动。","自动截图验证界面样式变更，主题开发视觉调试更直观。"],"ai_comment":"既然AI能修Bug，那我以后是不是只负责“你好”和“牛逼”了？这才是真正的外包。","ai_tags":["开发者向","效率党必备"],"ai_score":9},{"source":"Reddit","title":"Testers needed for a wearOS Obsidian vault viewer/editor","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/ObsidianMD/comments/1qpz9cc/testers_needed_for_a_wearos_obsidian_vault/","author":"/u/R00bot","created_at":"2026-01-29T04:58:27+00:00","content_text":"<table> <tr><td> <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/ObsidianMD/comments/1qpz9cc/testers_needed_for_a_wearos_obsidian_vault/\"> <img src=\"https://preview.redd.it/e5g4w4t7x7gg1.png?width=640&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4522761302013ab55133d70caf6fe6d87db23ef4\" alt=\"Testers needed for a wearOS Obsidian vault viewer/editor\" title=\"Testers needed for a wearOS Obsidian vault viewer/editor\" /> </a> </td><td> <!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>Hi all, </p> <p>I&#39;m working on Diamond for Obsidian, a wearOS app that lets you view and edit your Obsidian vault on your wrist, alongside an Android companion app that enables snycing to keep your vault up to date.</p> <p>The app is nearing release, I just need testers to get it onto the play store.

So I designed this feature that is similar to Tana&#39;s supertag, and I call it Flow Tag.</p> <p>When I finish recording, I can assign a tag to the voice memo, and the tag is configured with a small prompt for AI to turn the voice memo into a list of tasks in markdown format. I have an Events tag that will interpret the voice memo and add a due date in the Obsidian Tasks plugin format (the task management plugin I use in Obsidian), so when the note gets exported to Obsidian, the tasks plugin can pick up so my daily notes will have these items populated automatically. There is also a configurable markdown template you can customize so each Flow Tag export can have slightly different properties, allowing Obsidian Bases or other plugins to pick up these voice memos.</p> <p>I have also added the app on Apple watch, so I can just record on my watch and get the voice memo transcribed and sent to Obsidian once I open the app.</p> <p>I am inviting people with similar needs to try it out and give me feedback.

As in, I want my graph view to point to multiple things inside my PDF, not to see the PDF itself as a single graph dot.</p> <p>The only semi-success I’ve had is with the PDF graph view, by using tags for things I want highlighted.</p> <p>The most important thing I want clarified is the first part. And if that is not possible, is it possible to create such a format in Obsidian and what would be the best way to go about it.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Educational-Bad-8010\"> /u/Educational-Bad-8010 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/ObsidianMD/comments/1qptxuu/onenote_import_and_pdf_graph_view/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/ObsidianMD/comments/1qptxuu/onenote_import_and_pdf_graph_view/\">[comments]</a></span>","_source_key":"reddit","ai_summary":"OneNote 迁移排版大乱斗，PDF 深度图谱只是幻想","ai_pain_point":"OneNote 自由画布布局导入后图文错位，PDF 仅支持文件级引用无法内联","ai_highlights":["识别排版逻辑差异，提前规避 OneNote 迁移的格式陷阱","突破文件链接限制，构建 PDF 文档内部的深度关联图谱"],"ai_comment":"OneNote 的自由画布是 Markdown 的天敌，想无损迁移不如手打。想要 PDF 内联图谱，那得把插件开发者逼疯。","ai_tags":["数据迁移","学术党福音"],"ai_score":4},{"source":"Reddit","title":"I feel this should be achievable but it’s not clicking","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/ObsidianMD/comments/1qpt5ws/i_feel_this_should_be_achievable_but_its_not/","author":"/u/godarchmage","created_at":"2026-01-29T00:27:44+00:00","content_text":"<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>I just go into interstitial journaling and I need help in achieving some things.</p> <p>- I want to insert current time without the need for a plugin.
